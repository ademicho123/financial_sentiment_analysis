Heathrow airport records busiest day,"Heathrow has experienced its busiest ever day for passengers numbers.

The airport said 268,000 passengers travelled through its terminals on June 30.

It recorded a daily total in excess of 260,000 passengers five times during the month, including on consecutive days on June 23 and 24.

Across the month as a whole, the airport saw 7.4 million passengers, up 5.6% from 7.0 million during the same month last year.

Heathrow said it has more than 90,000 staff working at the airport – more than ever before – including a “baggage resilience team” and hundreds of “helpers” to assist passengers.

British Airways suffered a technical fault that disrupted its baggage system at Heathrow on June 25.

This meant many travellers on departing flights did not have their checked-in luggage put on the plane, while some of those on arriving flights faced long delays to retrieve their baggage.

Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye said: “June has seen more Heathrow records shattered including serving more passengers in a single day than ever before.

“I want to thank all my colleagues who went the extra mile to make sure the 268,000 passengers travelling on the busiest day had a smooth, stress-free journey.”

He added: “We have started summer as we mean to go on.”

Meanwhile, a regulator has reduced the amount Heathrow can charge airlines for using the airport until the end of 2026.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it has decreased the cap in fees from previously announced figures by £1.52 to £23.73 per passenger next year and by £1.57 to £23.71 per passenger in 2026.

It did this in response to a determination by competition regulator the Competition and Markets Authority that took into account appeals from the airport and airlines British Airways, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic.

The CAA said the price reductions reflect changes in Heathrow’s debt calculation, the cost of the airport’s pension payments and business rates, and its recovery of revenues lost due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Charges are paid by airlines but are generally passed on to passengers in air fares."
Aer Lingus pilots suspend industrial action with new pay deal,"Aer Lingus' pilots union called off its industrial action and recommended that members accept a pay proposal, the union said on Wednesday, ending a dispute that has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights.

""The pilot body will move immediately to suspend ongoing work-to-rule action, in place since 26th June, pending the outcome of a ballot,"" the Irish Air Lines Pilots’ Association (IALPA) said in an emailed statement.

Under work-to-rule, a form of industrial action, employees perform their duties strictly to the letter of the labour contract without taking on any additional duties.

Pilots began the industrial action on June 26, demanding a 24% pay increase to compensate for several years of inflation and cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aer Lingus, part of the IAG group of airlines, on Monday said it would accept the Labour Court recommendation, which includes a pilot pay increase of 17.75% for the four years to the end of 2026.

“Aer Lingus welcomes Forsa’s/IALPA’s recommendation of acceptance of the Labour Court recommendation and its decision to discontinue the industrial action,"" the airline said in a statement.

Pilots’ union recommends Aer Lingus pay deal,"Aer Lingus pilots will be asked to accept a 17.75% pay increase in a ballot, following a recommendation by their representative body.

It comes after a work-to-rule, which began at the end of June, resulted in the airline cancelling hundreds of flights.

The 17.75% figure was recommended by the Labour Court following engagement with Aer Lingus and the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (Ialpa).

Ialpa leadership sought clarifications from the Labour Court over the non-binding recommendation and, following consideration of the terms, recommended that its membership accept them.

The pilot body will move immediately to suspend its ongoing work-to-rule action, in place since June 26, pending the outcome of a ballot.

The union will hold a series of engagements with members before a ballot on the terms of the Labour Court recommendation in the coming week.

Ialpa president Mark Tighe described the pay increase provided for in the recommendation as a significant win for pilots.

Taoiseach Simon Harris has welcomed the developments.

In a statement, he said: “I welcome the decision by Ialpa to suspend industrial action and recommend acceptance of the Labour Court proposal.

“This is a very positive development for the travelling public and our tourism sector.

“I have consistently stated that compromise and engagement was the only way forward.”

Aer Lingus welcomed Ialpa’s recommendation to its members to accept the deal, as well as the decision to discontinue industrial action.

It said: “We look forward to Ialpa completing the balloting process as soon as possible.”

Earlier, Aer Lingus cancelled 25 more flights next Monday and Tuesday and said it would contact affected customers.

It also said more cancellations would be announced on Thursday.

Hundreds of flights have been cancelled in the two weeks since the industrial action began, which has affected thousands of holidaymakers’ plans.

Aer Lingus said those affected by flight cancellations will be given the option to change their flights for free or to claim a refund or voucher.

Customers can check the flights affected on the Aer Lingus Travel Advisory page.

The airline said the industrial relations dispute had been “enormously damaging both financially and reputationally”.

The pilots had initially sought a pay increase of 24%, which they said equated to inflation since the last pay rise in 2019.

They had previously rejected a Labour Court recommendation for pay increases of 9%, but Ialpa had suggested the union would consider a pay increase below the 24% figure."
Aer Lingus pilots to vote on pay proposal to end strike,"Aer Lingus' pilots union executive is to meet on Tuesday to consider a pay proposal to end industrial action that has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights, the Irish Air Lines Pilots’ Association (IALPA) said.

The union then plans to hold an electronic ballot of members on the Labour Court proposal, it said in a statement.

Pilots began work-to-rule industrial action on June 26, demanding a 24% pay increase to compensate for several years of inflation and cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aer Lingus, part of the IAG group of airlines, on Monday said it would accept the Labour Court recommendation, which includes a pilot pay increase of 17.75% for the four years to the end of 2026.

It had earlier said it would only go beyond a 12.25% increase if pilots agreed to changes in work practices."
British Airways risks compensation bill for delayed passengers in £100m legal case,"Millions of passengers could be compensated for late flights if a landmark legal case against British Airways and easyJet proves successful.

British Airways and easyJet are battling to throw out the case, which risks forcing airlines to pay out hundreds of millions of pounds to passengers over late flights.

The two carriers have been sued in the High Court over claims they must automatically compensate travellers whose flights are severely delayed or cancelled.

This could potentially lead to a massive overhaul in how passengers are reimbursed for travel chaos, as they will no longer have to submit claims themselves if their trip is disrupted.

Lawyers have identified up to 100,000 flights that were either delayed or cancelled since 2016, potentially landing BA and easyJet with a damages bill of at least £100m.

If successful, the case could also pave the way for vast payouts across the industry, raising the stakes for airlines worst hit by delays and cancellations.


Passengers are entitled to compensation of up to £520 if their flights are delayed by more than three hours but it is then down to them to contact the airlines themselves to make a claim.

This has raised concerns that many travellers are unaware of their rights, with few taking up the opportunity to seek compensation.

BA and easyJet will seek to fight off the case in a two-day court hearing this week. The airlines have argued that the lawsuit is “misconceived” and part of an attempt by lawyers to profit from passengers.

It is expected to reignite discussions over chronic travel disruption, which has been a significant issue ever since the pandemic as staff shortages and air traffic control chaos triggered delays and cancellations.

It comes as families prepare to jet off on their summer holidays, with new figures showing that BA has cancelled more than 4,000 flights from UK airports over the past year – more than double the number of cancellations by easyJet.

After the claim was first launched last year, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which? Rocio Concha said: “While airlines already have a legal responsibility to inform passengers of their rights to compensation and assistance when things go wrong, too often we hear that this is not taking place.

“That this case needs to be brought at all once again exposes the UK’s feeble passenger rights protections.”


BA chief Sean Doyle, who took over in late 2020, has been attempting to overhaul the company.

BA faced fresh scrutiny last month after it was struck by a technical fault across its baggage systems, meaning some passengers were forced to fly without their suitcases while others were delayed for hours.

Both BA and easyJet have instructed City law firms to fight the brewing class action, which is being brought by an individual backed by litigation funders.

An easyJet spokesman said: “Not only do we believe this has no legal or procedural basis, this action is being brought in order to profit by taking a cut from every claim when there are already existing and easy routes for eligible customers to receive 100pc of their compensation.”

A BA spokesman said: “We comply with our obligations under the Regulation. We don’t believe this claim has a proper legal basis – it’s misconceived and therefore along with easyJet we’ve applied to strike it out.

“In any event, we will continue to strongly defend our position. Customers can submit compensation requests directly to us online or by writing to our customer relations team to receive full payment for eligible claims.”"
"Flights to cost more because of net zero, warns British Airways owner","The boss of British Airways owner IAG has warned that air fares are poised to rise across Europe as carriers pass on the cost of net zero to passengers.

Plans to offer low-carbon flights reliant upon sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which costs up to six times as much as traditional kerosene, will have a “big impact” on prices, said Luis Gallego.

He said: “Flying is going to be more expensive. We are trying to improve efficiency to mitigate that, but it will have an impact on demand.”

Targets set by Brussels indicate that European airlines must use at least 6pc sustainable fuel by 2030, with this rising to 10pc for carriers operating in the UK.

This is part of a push to achieve net zero carbon emissions across the industry by 2050.

Mr Gallego’s comments come after British Airways rival Lufthansa last month announced a surcharge on tickets to fund decarbonisation.

The German airline said the levy will add between €1 and €72 (85p-£61) per ticket from next year.

Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive
Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, says introduction of sustainable aviation fuel could increase cost of a return trip to New York by £40 - Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg
Shai Weiss, the Virgin Atlantic chief executive, told The Telegraph in May that the introduction of SAF will mean the cost of a return trip to New York will rise by £40 based on current prices.

Mr Gallego said that the mandatory targets in Europe risk putting carriers in the region at a competitive disadvantage compared with those in other parts of the world.

He told the Financial Times: “We need to do it in a consistent way worldwide not to jeopardise European aviation. The reality is we do not have enough SAF, and the SAF we have is very expensive.”

Less than 1pc of total aviation fuel consumption came from sustainable sources last year, prompting airlines such as British Airways to demand government intervention to help increase the supply of SAF.

The fuel, made from used cooking oil and animal fat, is viewed as the most practical route towards reducing aviation’s net CO2 emission before new technologies, such as hydrogen propulsion, become available in the future.

IAG said decisions on pricing are a matter for its individual airlines, which also include Spain’s Iberia and Aer Lingus of Ireland, but that there are no immediate plans to impose decarbonisation-related surcharges.

Mr Gallego said a decision by Brussels on Wednesday to clear Lufthansa’s purchase of a 41pc stake in ITA, the Italian flag carrier and successor to bankrupt Alitalia, was “positive news”.

IAG shares rose following the announcement amid hopes Brussels will soon also clear its own bid for Spanish leisures carrier Air Europa."
Labour Court considers recommendations in Aer Lingus pilots dispute,"The Labour Court is considering recommendations in the dispute between Aer Lingus management and its pilots, as the airline announced further flight cancellations.

The recommendations from the industrial disputes body is expected to take several days.

Aer Lingus has said a further 76 additional flights will be cancelled between next Monday and Wednesday as the pay dispute between the airline and the pilots rumbles on.

The airline has been cancelling flights in batches during the pilots’ indefinite work-to-rule, which began last Wednesday, in an effort to protect services from the “highly disruptive” industrial action.

Donal Moriarty, the chief corporate affairs officer at Aer Lingus, thanked the court for conducting “a comprehensive” hearing, and said it was “an important step” in the dispute.

“The court is now considering what the parties had to say and will make its recommendation in due course, and Aer Lingus will await that recommendation.”

He said he wouldn’t discuss what was said in the hearing out of respect for the court.

“Aer Lingus is hopeful that the intervention of the court will be helpful in ultimately getting a resolution to this dispute.

“So we would remain hopeful that that can happen and certainly today was an important step in that regard.”

Captain Mark Tighe, president of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (Ialpa), said he remained hopeful of a resolution and would be balloting their members on the recommendations.

Ialpa members rejected a previous interim Labour Court recommendation for pay increases of 9.25% last month.

“Corporate greed cannot be allowed to go on like this,” Mr Tighe said.

He said there would be no escalation of industrial action while the Labour Court considers its recommendations, but said earlier in the week if these rounds of talks fail, it will consider an escalation.

The talks at the industrial dispute body are the latest attempt to bring the two sides together to hammer out a resolution.

After facilitating eight hours of discussions on Monday, the Labour Court decided to host a formal meeting on Wednesday, after which it will issue recommendations.

Ahead of both sides meeting at the building on Lansdowne Road on Wednesday, Aer Lingus announced further flight cancellations to limit the impact of the industrial action on people’s travel plans.

It said it would contact affected customers from today to offer a flight change free of charge, a refund or a voucher.

A list of the impacted flights can bee seen on the Travel Advisory page on the Aer Lingus website.

“Aer Lingus fully understands the anxiety being experienced by customers given the uncertainty caused by Ialpa’s industrial action and is giving impacted customers as many options as possible,” it said in a statement.

The pilots had been seeking a pay increase of 24%, which they say equates to inflation since the last pay rise in 2019.

However, Ialpa said last week that it would be willing to consider a lower pay increase.

Aer Lingus industrial action

But it accused Aer Lingus of not making a similar compromise to move from its offer of 12.25%, without requests for pilots to improve productivity.

On his way into the Labour Court, Mr Tighe said that Ireland is “a small but very successful open economy”.

“While attracting business, it must be acknowledged that business owners who do not protect their employees from inflation in a successful environment are ultimately and in time going to impoverish their employees.

“That will happen from the lowest employees as they slide off the bottom one by one.

“We asked the Labour Court to consider as we go forward, the profitable nature of the company and how a reasonable claim is to protect us all from inflation.”

Mr Moriarty, the chief corporate affairs officer at Aer Lingus, apologised to customers for the 470 flight cancellations to date.

“We are trying to communicate as effectively as possible with our customers, giving them the options to rebook, to refund or to rearrange their travel.

“But we do appreciate that this is very disruptive upon them and that’s uppermost in our mind.

“We’d like to go through the process of seeing what the court recommend and address the consequences of that afterwards rather than now.”

He added: “The reason for the cancellations is to build resilience into our schedule, to limit the number of cancellations actually, because without that resilience and that buffer within our operation, there would be more cancellations.

“The nature of the work to rule is cumulative. As rosters age they deteriorate and an unwillingness to accept changes to rosters on a daily basis means that the roster deteriorates over time and that’s what causes the impact in terms of cancellations.”

Finance Minister Jack Chambers said the industrial dispute has been “incredibly damaging” for the Irish economy.

“I think it has caused enormous disruption to many tourists but also Irish people who were looking forward to that holiday abroad,” he said.

“I think the dispute, up to this point, has been far too entrenched between both sides. I welcome the fact that they’re in a process now in the Labour Court, and hopefully we will get a successful resolution of it.

“But I’d say there’s ongoing concern that, if this persists, it’s going to cause continued damage from a tourism and economic perspective.”"
Aer Lingus forced to cancel 76 additional flights as pay row rumbles on,"Aer Lingus has said it will cancel 76 additional flights between next Monday and Wednesday as the pay dispute between the airline and the union representing its pilots rumbles on.

It comes as Aer Lingus and the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (Ialpa) are meeting at the Labour Court on Wednesday afternoon.

The talks at the industrial dispute body are the latest attempt to bring the two sides together to hammer out a resolution.

Aer Lingus said the latest round of flight cancellations is being made “in order to protect as many services as possible from the continuing and highly disruptive impact of Ialpa’s continuing industrial action”.

The airline said customers will be given the option of changing their flight free of charge, or claiming a refund or a voucher.

A spokesman said: “Aer Lingus has had to take the step of cancelling 76 additional flights over the course of Monday 8th July to Wednesday 10th July (inclusive).

“Implementing these cancellations is to enable us to protect as many services as possible for as many of our customers as possible.

“These cancellations will be implemented today, and details will be communicated to impacted customers. Details of the services impacted are set out on the Travel Advisory page of aerlingus.com.

“Customers impacted by these latest cancellations between 8th July and 10th July will be given the option to change their flights for free. They will also be able to claim a refund or voucher.

“We asked the Labour Court to consider as we go forward, the profitable nature of the company and how a reasonable claim is to protect us all from inflation.”

Going into the talks, Mr Tighe said he is “always hopeful” the matter will be resolved.

He also said that if there is a recommendation arising from the court, the industrial action will still continue.

“The executive in the first instance will consider it and then the members will consider it thereafter,” he added.

Donal Moriarty, the chief corporate affairs officer at Aer Lingus, apologised to customers for the 470 flight cancellations.

The meeting is being held a week after Ialpa began an indefinite work-to-rule, resulting in them withdrawing from out-of-hours services.

An eight-hour strike was also held on Saturday, during which hundreds of pilots marched around the airport, holding signs that read “Two years talking, deal now” and “No pilots, no profits”.

The industrial action has resulted in almost 400 flights being cancelled and affected the travel plans tens of thousands of passengers.

The airline admitted the dispute has caused “significant financial and reputational damage”.

Finance Minister Jack Chambers said the industrial dispute has been “incredibly damaging” for the Irish economy.

“I think it has caused enormous disruption to many tourists but also Irish people who were looking forward to that holiday abroad,” he added.

The pilots had been seeking a pay increase of 24%, which they say equates to inflation since the last pay rise in 2019.

However, Ialpa said during a meeting with the airline at a hotel last week that it would be willing to consider a lower increase.

But it accused Aer Lingus of not making a similar compromise to move from its offer of 12.25%, without requests for pilots to improve productivity.

If these rounds of talks fail, Ialpa said it will return to consider an escalation of its industrial action.

An interim Labour Court recommendation for pay increases of 9.25% was rejected by Ialpa members last month, and they then decided to pursue industrial action."
Gatwick’s runway closed after British Airways plane has ‘hot brakes’,"Thousands of airline passengers on flights to and from Gatwick airport are suffering disruption after the runway was closed following a problem with a departing British Airways plane.

Airport fire service vehicles escorted the aircraft as it was moved off the runway, flight tracking website Flightradar24 said.

The incident involved British Airways flight BA2279 to Vancouver, Canada.

Flightradar24 reported the closure of the runway at 12.53pm and stated at 1.14pm it had reopened.

A Gatwick airport spokesperson said: “The main runway was closed for a short time today due to a departing aircraft having hot brakes.

“Safety is our top priority and the dedicated airport fire service swiftly attended to support the aircraft.

“A number of flights were diverted. The runway is now open and operating as normal.”

A British Airways spokesperson said: “Our pilots took the precautionary decision to cancel take-off due to a technical issue.

“Safety is always our top priority and we apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused.”"
Aer Lingus set for fresh talks with pilots in bid to resolve pay dispute,"Fresh talks between Aer Lingus and its pilots will convene on Thursday amid efforts to find a resolution to a bitter industrial dispute that has seen 270 flights already cancelled.

The indefinite work-to-rule commenced on Wednesday with pilots now refusing to work overtime, accept changes to set rosters, or take on out-of-hours management requests.

An eight-hour strike is also planned for Saturday.

A resolution to the stand-off looked a long way away after the Irish Labour Court told both sides on Tuesday it will not be intervening at the present time.

AerLingus strikes

But on Wednesday afternoon, the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (Ialpa) said it had accepted an invitation to talks with Aer Lingus as the work-to-rule continues.

The airline and Ialpa, a branch of the Forsa trade union, have been involved in a heated exchange of words in recent days, with each accusing the other of not engaging.

The pilots are seeking a pay increase of 24%, which they say equates to inflation since the last pay rise in 2019.

Aer Lingus has said it is willing to offer pay increases of 12.5% or above if “improvements in productivity and flexibility” are discussed.

They are expected to meet at 9.30am on Thursday.

The travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers have been affected, with the airline having been working to offer refunds or alternative flights to people whose trips have been axed.

Taoiseach Simon Harris has welcomed news of fresh talks.

A spokesperson for Mr Harris said: “The Taoiseach has been clear this dispute is having a disproportionate impact on the travelling public.

“All disputes are resolved by compromise and negotiation. The Taoiseach urges both sides to engage in good faith to resolve this dispute.”

With passengers told of cancellations days in advance, there were not many visible signs of disruption at Dublin Airport as the action began on Wednesday.

Passengers who arrived hoped their flight would not be cancelled at the last minute, and described their nerves over recent days.

At Terminal 2 of Dublin Airport on Wednesday morning, those passengers whose flights were not cancelled were in good spirits.

Audrey from Galway, who was headed to Bilbao with her family, said she had received an email on Saturday to say their flight was going ahead, which reassured them.

“But, between last Wednesday and Saturday, it was very upsetting, wondering whether we’d be able to go,” she said.

“It’s our one family holiday of the year and obviously we wanted it to go ahead because otherwise there would be a lot of consternation in the house. So we’re happy ours is going ahead, and feel sorry for anyone else who isn’t able to go today.”

She said they were flying back with Aer Lingus, and had an extra few days off before they returned to work.

“We’re just willing to wing it and see how we go. We had checked alternative flights and even ferries if this hadn’t gone ahead, just in case. But once we’re there, we’ll be happy,” she said.

“The thought of not getting there is the issue, but once you’re there you’re relaxed.”

Asked about whether she supported the industrial action, she said it seemed to her that there was a good offer on the table.

“I suppose I’m probably not as incredibly angry as someone whose flight has been cancelled, but I think it is difficult to sympathise with the pilots to be honest with you, because they are well paid to begin with,” she said.

Diarmuid, who is from Dublin and travelling to France, said the pilots “had to do it at some stage”.

“I can see the justification for it. If it’s an all-out strike then we’re in awful trouble, but this work-to-rule has allowed a certain amount of flow of passengers. I’d love more transparency from the company about profit levels,” he said.

Catherine, who is from Dublin but lives in Minnesota, in the US, said her flight was not affected, but that she had been “anxious” coming up to the flight.

“I think it’s rotten because it affects so many families going on holidays, but they do it because that’s the height of negotiations. I really feel for families,” she said.

“If you are making record profits, you should give back to the people who took a nosedive during Covid, but you also can’t be greedy.”

Parents travelling abroad with their children spoke of their concerns about whether they would have to break bad news to their children excited about their holidays.

Passengers appeared happy once their flight to their destination continued, and willing to extend their stay if needed.

A woman who is flying to the US said she had been anxious in the run-up to Wednesday and had had a “wait-and-see approach”.

Asked if she was flying back with Aer Lingus, she said “hopefully”.

“I didn’t think they would resolve it, because I can’t see them getting what they want, truthfully. I feel sorry for the cabin crew and the ground crew,” she said.

Both sides in the dispute agreed to attend separate meetings at the Labour Court in Dublin on Tuesday to provide briefings on the industrial stand-off.

After its meeting, Aer Lingus said it was “disappointed” the court had assessed that it could not currently assist to bridge the gap between the sides.

Ialpa president Mark Tighe made clear the action would proceed “until there is a resolution”.

“Pilots in the union do not want to be in this situation,” Mr Tighe told RTE Radio on Wednesday.

“This is the middle of the summer, any day (of industrial action) is going to have a significant impact.

“What you see here is the direct result of management actions and their refusal to acknowledge that they should have been dealing with inflation as they went along.”

During leaders’ questions in the Dail on Wednesday, Sinn Fein’s Louise O’Reilly accused the Government of a “hands off” approach and said people were looking for leadership and “a high level intervention”.

Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys said she fully understands “how frustrating and upsetting” it is for people whose travel plans have been affected.

The Labour Court remains available to the parties, she said, and the situation will be reviewed comprehensively on July 1. In the meantime, both sides have been urged not to escalate the dispute further.

Ms Humphreys said “intensive efforts must be made by both parties” and said they must “get back to the table”.

“I think what we need here is we need cool heads, we need to leave the egos at the door, and get back into that negotiating room – I’m saying that to both parties,” Ms Humphreys told the chamber.

“If everyone sticks to their own position, we’re never going to find a solution.

“I’m saying to them: start talking, this will be resolved. There has to be compromise, they have to talk.”

“Get back to the table, resolve this issue, there’s a solution, there’s always a solution,” she said."
Aer Lingus passengers describe anxiety over industrial action,"The first day of industrial action by Aer Lingus pilots got under way without much disruption on Wednesday, as an Irish minister called for “cool heads” in the bitter dispute.

Aer Lingus has already cancelled 270 flights over the coming days due to industrial action by pilots over pay.

“I suppose I’m probably not as incredibly angry as someone whose flight has been cancelled, but I think it is difficult to sympathise with the pilots to be honest with you, because they are well paid to begin with,” she said.

Diarmuid, who is from Dublin and travelling to France, said the pilots “had to do it at some stage”.

“I can see the justification for it. If it’s an all-out strike then we’re in awful trouble, but this work-to-rule has allowed a certain amount of flow of passengers. I’d love more transparency from the company about profit levels,” he said.

Catherine, who is from Dublin but lives in Minnesota, in the US, said her flight was not affected, but that she had been “anxious” coming up to the flight.

“I think it’s rotten because it affects so many families going on holidays, but they do it because that’s the height of negotiations. I really feel for families,” she said.

“If you are making record profits, you should give back to the people who took a nosedive during Covid, but you also can’t be greedy.”

Parents travelling abroad with their children spoke of their concerns about whether they would have to break bad news to their children excited about their holidays.


Passengers appeared happy once their flight to their destination continued, and willing to extend their stay if needed.

A woman who is flying to the US said she had been anxious in the run up to Wednesday and had had a “wait-and-see approach”.

Asked if she was flying back with Aer Lingus, she said “hopefully”.

“I didn’t think they would resolve it, because I can’t see them getting what they want, truthfully. I feel sorry for the cabin crew and the ground crew,” she said.

The airline and the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (Ialpa), a branch of the Forsa trade union, have been involved in a heated exchange of words in recent days, with each accusing the other of not engaging.

The pilots are seeking a pay increase of 24%, which they say equates to inflation since the last pay rise in 2019.

Aer Lingus has said it is willing to offer pay increases of 12.5% or above if “improvements in productivity and flexibility” are discussed.

Both sides agreed to attend separate meetings at the Labour Court in Dublin on Tuesday to provide briefings on the industrial stand-off.

After its meeting, Aer Lingus said it was “disappointed” the court had assessed that it could not currently assist to bridge the gap between the sides.

“Aer Lingus has made it clear that it remains available for discussions both directly and through the state’s industrial relations framework,” it said.

Ialpa president Mark Tighe made clear the action would proceed “until there is a resolution”.

Aer Lingus industrial action

“Pilots in the union do not want to be in this situation,” Mark Tighe told RTE Radio on Wednesday.

“This is the middle of the summer, any day (of industrial action) is going to have a significant impact.

“What you see here is the direct result of management actions and their refusal to acknowledge that they should have been dealing with inflation as they went along.”

Political pressure is increasing on the Irish Government to help resolve the dispute, with Irish premier Simon Harris asking both sides to “dig deep” in an attempt to come to a resolution.

During leaders’ questions, Sinn Fein’s Louise O’Reilly accused the Government of a “hands off” approach and said people were were looking for leadership and “a high level intervention”.

Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys said she fully understands “how frustrating and upsetting” it is for people whose travel plans have been affected.

The Labour Court remains available to the parties, she said, and the situation will be reviewed comprehensively on July 1. In the meantime, both sides have been urged not to escalate the dispute further.

Ms Humphreys said “intensive efforts must be made by both parties” and said they must “get back to the table”.

“I think what we need here is we need cool heads, we need to leave the egos at the door, and get back into that negotiating room – I’m saying that to both parties,” Ms Humphreys told the chamber.

“If everyone sticks to their own position, we’re never going to find a solution.

“I’m saying to them: start talking, this will be resolved. There has to be compromise, they have to talk.”

“Get back to the table, resolve this issue, there’s a solution, there’s always a solution,” she said."
British Airways passengers suffer baggage chaos at Heathrow,"British Airways has apologised to passengers after a “temporary technical fault” disrupted its baggage system at Heathrow Airport.

Many travellers on flights departing from the west London airport did not have their checked-in luggage put on the plane, while some of those on arriving flights faced long delays to retrieve their baggage.

The PA news agency understands the issue – which also caused many flights to be delayed by several hours – began on Tuesday afternoon and was resolved towards the end of the day.

A British Airways spokesman said: “We’ve apologised to those customers who were unable to travel with their luggage due to a temporary technical fault that was outside of our control.

“This issue has been resolved and we’ve brought in additional colleagues to support our teams in getting bags back to our customers as quickly as possible.”

A Heathrow spokesperson said: “British Airways experienced a technical issue with their allocation system. This has now been resolved.

“Our teams are on site supporting BA with their recovery.

“We advise passengers to check with BA before travelling to the airport as BA passengers in Terminal 5 may still be impacted. No other airline is impacted.”

Claire Wills, 41, said she feels “very anxious” about “when, how and even if” she will get her luggage back after flying into Heathrow Airport from Tirana, Albania, and waiting three hours for her suitcase only to be told to go home without it.

The lawyer from London told PA: “There were so many confused and crying people in T5 yesterday. I’m deeply disappointed and frustrated with BA, there were hardly any staff there and only about two announcements in the three hours I was there to explain what was happening.

“It felt like both BA and Heathrow were burying their heads in the sand and didn’t want to openly admit there was a problem.”

A woman in her 60s, Francesca Bellis-Jones, told PA she waited about an hour for her luggage at Heathrow airport after flying back from Crete with her husband, before eventually leaving without their bags.

The semi-retired milliner based in Hazlemere in Buckinghamshire said the couple were waiting at the luggage belt when “eventually one of the passengers appeared waving some paper and she was telling people that the luggage wasn’t coming out at all”.

She said: “Of course everyone was going crazy trying to find out what was happening. The staff gave no information at all apart from giving out these sheets telling you how to register that you hadn’t got your luggage.”

“I’m very annoyed about it as well as upset. I don’t think it’s too much to ask that an airline like BA in an airport like Heathrow gets right the fairly simple job of unloading suitcases from a plane.”

Writing on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, one passenger who flew into Heathrow described the situation as a “shambles”.

He added: “No info told just to go home. But need the bag for a wedding tomorrow and you’re telling me 48 hours for my bag!!!”

Another wrote: “Flew to Newcastle from Heathrow last night with @British_Airways.

“No updates or info provided by BA – flight arrived 3 hours late & without baggage.

“One staff member stood in baggage reclaim with a laminated piece of paper with a QR code to a portal that doesn’t work. Disgraceful.”"
Aer Lingus pilots begin industrial action,"Industrial action by Aer Lingus pilots that has already seen 270 flights cancelled has begun.

The indefinite work-to-rule commenced at midnight with pilots now refusing to work overtime, accept changes to set rosters, or take on out-of-hours management requests.

An eight-hour strike is also planned for Saturday.


The travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers have been affected, with the airline having been working to offer refunds or alternative flights to those whose trips have been axed.

At Terminal 2 of Dublin Airport on Wednesday morning, Aer Lingus passengers whose flights were not cancelled were in good spirits.

Audrey from Galway, who was headed to Bilbao with her family, said she had received an email on Saturday to say their flight was going ahead, which reassured them.

“But between last Wednesday and Saturday it was very upsetting, wondering whether we’d be able to go,” she said.

“It’s our one family holiday of the year and obviously we wanted it to go ahead because otherwise there would be a lot of consternation in the house. So we’re happy ours is going ahead, and feel sorry for anyone else who isn’t able to go today.”

She said they were flying back with Aer Lingus, and had an extra few days off before they returned to work.

“We’re just willing to wing it and see how we go. We had checked alternative flights and even ferries if this hadn’t gone ahead, just in case. But once we’re there, we’ll be happy,” she said.

“The thought of not getting there is the issue, but once you’re there you’re relaxed.”

Asked about whether she supported the industrial action, she said it seemed to her that there was a good offer on the table.

“I suppose I’m probably not as incredibly angry as someone whose flight has been cancelled, but I think it is difficult to sympathise with the pilots to be honest with you, because they are well paid to begin with,” she said.

A resolution to the bitter dispute over pay does not look imminent after the Irish Labour Court told both sides on Tuesday it will not be intervening at the present time.

The airline and the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (Ialpa), a branch of the Forsa trade union, have been involved in a heated exchange of words in recent days, with each accusing the other of not engaging.

The pilots are seeking a pay increase of 24%, which they say equates to inflation since the last pay rise in 2019.

“Aer Lingus has made it clear that it remains available for discussions both directly and through the state’s industrial relations framework,” the airline’s statement added.

“Aer Lingus will continue to focus on minimising the disruption caused to customers by Ialpa’s industrial action.

“Aer Lingus is calling upon Forsa/Ialpa to consider the damage that its continued industrial action is inflicting upon passengers, the company and the Irish economy.”

Aer Lingus industrial action

Emerging from the court, Ialpa president Mark Tighe made clear the action would proceed.

“The actions continue as they are notified and will continue until there is a resolution,” he said.

Irish premier Simon Harris has asked both sides to “dig deep” in an attempt to come to a resolution.

The Taoiseach said it is “absolutely vital” that both sides engage in talks to find a resolution.

“My challenge to the parties now is to bring that engagement forward, rather than putting people through a prolonged period of agony and chaos, and then engaging in the end anyway,” Mr Harris said on Tuesday.

“This dispute will be settled the same way every dispute is settled: compromise, engagement, sitting around a table. That’s what needs to happen.”

He said there would be “very little sympathy” for anybody involved in cancelling family holidays and disrupting the tourism sector if they are not engaging “intensively”."
"Aer Lingus pilots launch work-to-rule actions, tossing travel plans of passengers into disarray","Aer Lingus pilots said they would resume talks with the Irish airline after they launched an industrial action Wednesday that led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and tossed the travel plans of tens of thousands into disarray.

The pilots imposed ‘’work to rule’’ actions, refusing to work overtime, accepting changes in set rosters or taking out-of-hours management requests.

The Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association said it would resume talks Thursday with Aer Lingus as the labor action continues.

An eight-hour strike is planned on Saturday.

The flag carrier of Ireland and its pilots have been locked in a bitter dispute over pay, with pilots seeking a pay increase of 24% to keep pace with inflation since their last pay raise in 2019. Aer Lingus has said it is willing to offer pay increases of 12.5% or more if “productivity and flexibility” are discussed.

Ireland's prime minister, Simon Harris, said it is “absolutely vital” that a resolution is found.

“My challenge to the parties now is to bring that engagement forward, rather than putting people through a prolonged period of agony and chaos, and then engaging in the end anyway,” Harris said Tuesday. “This dispute will be settled the same way every dispute is settled: compromise, engagement, sitting around a table.

Aer Lingus and pilots to attend Labour Court ahead of planned industrial action,"Aer Lingus and pilots’ representatives are to attend meetings at Ireland’s Labour Court on Tuesday as efforts intensify to avert planned industrial action.

The airline has already cancelled more than 200 flights, affecting 35,000 passengers, ahead of the action by members of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (IALPA) amid a bitter dispute over pay.

A work-to-rule action will run from Wednesday to Sunday, with an eight-hour strike planned for Saturday.

Pilots are seeking a pay increase of 24%, which they say equates to inflation since the last pay rise in 2019.

Aer Lingus has said it is willing to offer pay increases of 12.5% or above if “improvements in productivity and flexibility” are discussed.

Both Aer Lingus and IALPA confirmed on Monday evening they would attend separate meetings at the Labour Court on Tuesday to provide briefings on the industrial stand-off.

The development was welcomed by Irish premier Simon Harris.

Earlier, Aer Lingus offered to meet the pilots to try to resolve the dispute.

Both sides described that move as “positive” and said they were hopeful that they could meet this week.

The more conciliatory tone came after tense exchanges between Aer Lingus and IALPA in recent days.

Aer Lingus had previously branded the pilots’ industrial action “insidious” and compared it to “blackmail”, while pilots accused the company of threats and “antagonism”.

The airline has said it has notified all passengers affected by the multiple cancellations and accommodated 80% with alternatives such as a refund or rebooking.

On Monday, Taoiseach Mr Harris used a meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) to voice his concerns about the Aer Lingus dispute.

The LEEF is made up of representatives from the Government, employers and trade unions and is used to facilitate dialogue on economic and employment issues affecting the labour market.

Mr Harris later welcomed the decision of Aer Lingus and unions to separately meet with the Labour Court.

“These meetings provide an opportunity to try to make progress and ensure the travelling public are not further affected by this dispute,” he said.

Ireland’s deputy premier Micheal Martin was asked about the issue as he attended a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday morning.

He said it was “shocking the degree to which the needs of those who travel are, in my view, being ignored in the context of this dispute”.

“There’s only one way to resolve this, it’s through negotiations and getting around the table. It is that simple, by the way,” he said.

“All disputes end and the most effective way that they end is by utilising the industrial relations machinery that we have available in the State, which is the WRC (Workplace Relations Commission) and the Labour Court.”

He said the Labour Court’s interim recommendation of a 9.5% increase in pay “does form the basis for further negotiations”.

“I would appeal to both sides to get around the table.”"
Are Investors Undervaluing International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAGY) Right Now?,"Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.

Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.

On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAGY) is a stock many investors are watching right now. ICAGY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.

Another valuation metric that we should highlight is ICAGY's P/B ratio of 1.56. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.46. Over the past year, ICAGY's P/B has been as high as 1.89 and as low as 1.54, with a median of 1.75.

Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. ICAGY has a P/S ratio of 0.13. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.38.

These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that International Consolidated Airlines Group is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, ICAGY feels like a great value stock at the moment."
Plane passengers ‘risking their lives’ by rescuing their bags during evacuations,"Airline passengers have been warned not to grab their luggage in an emergency after dozens of deaths in Russia were blamed on people trying to collect their baggage during an evacuation.

Industry bosses are increasingly concerned about the safety risk posed by people collecting their belongings before evacuating stricken aircraft. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) called attention to the issue at a recent gathering of airline chiefs, saying a refusal to head straight for the exit may lead to deaths.

Dozens of fatalities in a crash-landing in Russia were partly blamed on passengers ignoring the rules and blocking the aisle as they sought to retrieve their bags while the plane burned.

In 2019 people grabbed their luggage as an Aeroflot plane erupted in flames on a Moscow runway, leading to 41 deaths
In 2019 people grabbed their luggage as an Aeroflot plane erupted in flames on a Moscow runway, leading to 41 deaths
Regulators require airlines to run test evacuations to establish that a plane can be emptied within 90 seconds.

However, the propensity to reach for cases and laptops stowed in overhead lockers means that real-life evacuations are often very different from the tests.

Nick Careen, head of safety, security and operations at IATA, which represents 330 airlines, said the plethora of mobile phone footage showing people descending escape chutes while clutching their luggage has served to highlight the extent of the problem.

He said: “We have seen many examples where evacuations have gone very well, actually more of them than not.

“But when they don’t go well – and we do see examples like that becoming pretty prevalent – it’s something we need to latch on to.”

He added: “Fines never work, unfortunately. Despite the fact that this is a global standard and a requirement on every flight, the propensity is that it is still a challenge.

“The only way is to explain that there is a good reason for this, and that it’s for your own benefit. We need to educate the customer on why the regulations are there.”

Evacuation tests usually assume that the sole motivation is to get to the exit. However, in real-world cases, passengers often also want to protect their belongings.

In 2015, British Airways passengers were filmed dragging bags away from a jet that caught fire in Las Vegas, while in one of the most shocking incidents in 2019, people grabbed their luggage as an Aeroflot plane erupted in flames on a Moscow runway, leading to 41 deaths.

Last September, almost every person escaping an Air China aircraft that landed in Singapore with an engine on fire appeared to have retrieved their belongings

Last September, almost every person escaping an Air China aircraft that landed in Singapore with an engine on fire appeared to have retrieved their belongings, leading to delays at the top of the escape chutes and mass pile ups at the bottom.

Many of those fleeing a smoke-filled jet in Venezuela in April were also seen to have bags, with one woman carrying a particularly large case.

In January, all 379 people aboard a Japan Airlines jet that burst into flames after hitting a smaller plane at Tokyo Haneda airport were successfully evacuated.

Passengers abandoned their hand luggage and even their pets to escape down just three operational emergency slides.

But David Soucie, a former Federal Aviation Administration official, said that had the accident happened in the US, “it would have been a very different scenario because of our attachment to our carry-on bags, our laptops, our phones, our things that we want to take with us.”

Airlines themselves could be said to have helped create the issue through the introduction of charges for checked luggage two decades ago. This trend prompted passengers to opt for luggage that can be carried into cabins."
"EU vets IAG rivals' ability to take over Air Europa routes, sources say","EU antitrust regulators are asking whether rivals proposed by British Airways owner IAG to take over some of Spanish airline Air Europa's routes are capable of operating them and competing with IAG, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

IAG, which also owns Spanish airline Iberia, last week offered fresh concessions in a bid to allay the European Commission's worries about the impact of the deal on Spanish short- and long-haul flights.

These included making available 52% of Air Europa's 2023 flights to rivals, another source said. Ryanair, Volotea, Iberojet and Binter have signed memoranda of understanding with IAG for short-haul flights and Avianca and World2Fly for long-haul. The details of the MOUs were not disclosed.

The EU competition watchdog has asked rivals about the suitability and market strategy of the potential remedy takers, the people said.

The commission wants to know whether the rivals have the financial capability to operate the routes, and they have until this week to provide feedback, one of the people said.

The commission, which has set an Aug. 20 deadline for its decision, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

IAG, which owns a 20% stake in Air Europa, is paying 400 million euros ($429 million) to buy out remaining shares from Spanish tourism company Globalia, its second attempt after it abandoned a previous deal in 2021."
Alaska Air's (ALK) Arm Includes British Airways Flights,"Alaska Airlines, a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK, is gearing up to connect more passengers between London and the Pacific Northwest. To this end, Alaska Airlines is extending its partnership with British Airways (a founding member of the oneworld alliance) and making tickets available for British Airways flights to London directly at alaskaair.com.

Travelers can purchase British Airways flights at alaskaair.com between London Heathrow and Alaska's gateway airports in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as Chicago and New York JFK.

The frequency of British Airways flight availability to London from ALK’s West Coast gateways is in the following manner — Seattle (two daily flights); Portland (daily flight); San Francisco (two daily flights); Los Angeles (three daily flights); and San Diego (two daily flights). Nonstop British Airways flights from Chicago (three daily flights) and New York JFK (eight daily flights) are also available on the website.

Flights for the aforementioned routes will be available from Jun 18 onward. Starting later this year, travelers can buy Alaska Air’s flight tickets connecting to British Airways, along with flights beyond London on British Airways.

Andrew Harrison, chief commercial officer for Alaska Airlines, stated, ""We're excited to add our longstanding partner, British Airways, to our growing portfolio of alaskaair.com book direct airlines. London is one the most requested global gateways by our guests and no one serves it better than British Airways and the oneworld alliance.""

Considering London’s popularity on a global basis, with service between Seattle and London being one of the demanding routes for guests in the Pacific Northwest, the latest move is expected to boost Alaska Airlines’ revenue growth and strengthen its competitive position in the airline industry.

Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider
Currently, ALK carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Some better-ranked stocks for investors’ consideration in the Zacks Transportation sector include GATX Corporation GATX and Trinity Industries, Inc. (TRN). Each stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

GATX has an encouraging earnings surprise history. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters (missing the mark in the other). The average beat is 7.49%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised 3% upward over the past 90 days. GATX has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.79% for 2024. Shares of the company have rallied 18.4% in the past year.

Trinity raised 2024 earnings per share guidance to the range of $1.35 to $1.55 (which excludes items outside of the company’s core business operations) from $1.30 to $1.50 guided previously.

Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TRN’s 2024 earnings has been revised 2.7% upward. For 2024, TRN’s earnings are expected to grow 8.70% year over year."
IAG offers remedies to EU over Air Europa deal,"British Airways owner IAG has again offered remedies to the European Commission aimed at securing EU approval of its takeover of Spain's Air Europa.

""We submitted a new remedy package with some adjustments compared to the previous one,"" IAG said in an email.

""It includes improvements that have come from the constructive dialogue we have been maintaining with the European Commission, with the aim of ensuring that the acquisition of Air Europa is carried out with all guarantees for consumers.""

IAG, which owns Spanish airline Iberia, had proposed remedies in February which the EU's competition enforcer deemed insufficient.

The latest set of concessions will see Air Europa cede 52% of its 2023 flights to rivals and includes the names of competitors that have signed memoranda of understanding with IAG, a person familiar with the matter said.

The Commission, which usually seeks feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept remedies, has extended the deadline for its decision to Aug. 20.

IAG last month said it was in talks with Avianca, Binter, Iberojet, Ryanair, Volotea, and World2Fly to cede short-haul and long-haul routes to its rivals.

IAG is paying 400 million euros ($429 million) to Spanish tourism company Globalia for the 80% of Air Europa it does not own."
EU regulators extend deadline for IAG to offer remedies on Air Europa deal,"EU antitrust regulators have given British Airways-owner IAG more time to offer fresh remedies to ease their concerns about its bid for full control of Spain's Air Europa.

IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, had faced a Monday deadline to offer concessions but the deadline has now been extended to June 24 and the European Commission will make its decision by July 29, a spokesperson for the Commission said on Monday.

""On 7 June 2024, the Commission decided to extend the phase II procedure in this case by a total of 10 working days,"" the spokesperson said.

""Accordingly, the deadline for the parties to submit remedies in this case is now 24 June 2024, while the deadline for the Commission to take a decision is now 29 July 2024.""

IAG had in February proposed remedies which the EU competition enforcer had deemed insufficient to address worries about reduced competition in Spanish domestic routes and short-haul and long-haul routes as a result of the deal.

The carrier subsequently sought to allay regulators last month saying it was in talks with Avianca, Binter, Iberojet, Ryanair, Volotea, and World2Fly to cede long-haul and short-haul routes to its rivals.

It is also willing to give up more than 40% of Air Europa's 2023 flights to other airlines to boost competition.

IAG is paying 400 million euros ($430 million) to Spanish tourism company Globalia for the 80% of Air Europa it does not own to improve its Latin American market share, expand into Asia and allow its Madrid hub to compete with other major airports in Europe."
Why planes are being rattled by rising turbulence,"At some point, every frequent flier will have seen the seatbelt signs ping on mid-trip, and experienced a sudden lurch as their aircraft is buffeted by gusts of air.

It is fortunately very rare for turbulence to end in disaster. But during a Singapore Airlines flight from London last month, passengers were thrown around the cabin and a man died from a heart attack.

The death was the first connected to the phenomenon in 23 years – and follows the safest year recorded for air travel in 2023, with no fatal accidents involving passenger jets anywhere in the world.

However, it came against a backdrop of steadily increasing turbulence incidents. Just days later, a Dublin-bound service operated by Qatar Airways was buffeted over Turkey, leaving 12 people injured.

Airlines say it’s not clear whether the rise in turbulence stems from increasingly erratic weather patterns or is simply a result of the number of flights increasing by more than two-thirds in the past two decades.

Whatever the underlying cause, it was up there with the challenge of cutting carbon emissions as the hottest topic among airline bosses gathered in Dubai last week for the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association (Iata).

While there was agreement on the need to gather more data, quite how far the industry might be prepared to go with efforts to mitigate the risk of injuries is less clear.

Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates, the biggest long-haul airline, appeared to hint at an approach that could keep people in their seats for the whole flight.

He said: “Let’s be quite honest. If you haven’t got people strapped in, in some of the clear air turbulence interjections, it’s a real risk.

“So the whole industry is now upping the game with regard to making sure the passengers are strapped in. We are looking at all the protocols.

“I think that the industry will start being a lot more, let’s say, not restrictive, they will be more concerned about making sure that people are in their seats and strapped in.”

The comments sparked speculation that airline chiefs might be ready to adopt formal rules making it compulsory for people to remain belted up.

Iata pushed back against that suggestion, issuing a hasty press release that stated: “Airlines are not planning to require passengers to keep their seat belts on at all times.”

However, it reiterated that “airlines have long recommended that passengers fasten seatbelts when seated”.

Nick Careen, the organisation’s safety chief, told the summit: “When I get on an airplane I don’t take my seatbelt off unless I go to the washroom. I loosen it, but I keep it on. I think that’s pretty simple. It doesn’t take resources, it takes common sense.”

Careen said it’s now common in the US for pilots to tell passengers on “short flights” such as the near three-hour trip from Denver to Seattle (about the same as London to Malaga) that the seat belt sign will remain on throughout if there’s any potential for turbulence.

He said: “Seatbelts save lives in cars and air transport is no different. There used to be a time when passengers would get pretty impatient when that seat belt sign didn’t come off because they wanted their coffee, but now they realise it’s actually synonymous with safety.”

Whether a stag (or hen) party of Britons bound for Ibiza and eager for their next drink would be quite so understanding is open to debate.

Willie Walsh – Iata’s director general, one-time chief executive of British Airways and a former pilot – told the summit, while not playing down the issue, that “turbulence is nothing new”.

Mr Walsh said it was something he encountered frequently when he began flying with Aer Lingus 45 years ago. Crews then would make a report to air traffic controllers who would “pass the information on to other aircraft in the location if they had the opportunity”.

He said: “It’s been a factor in the industry for many, many years. We will continue to assess the recent events and try to understand if there’s anything else that can be done.”

The range of opinion captures the conundrum facing airlines as they grapple with the challenge of preventing turbulence-related deaths while at the same time avoiding a knee-jerk reaction that unnecessarily detracts from the passenger experience.

Turbulence comes in two forms. The best understood is encountered in clouds and at its most severe in thunderstorms, where aircraft can rise and fall sharply as they encounter rapidly moving air.

Modern weather forecasting and radars mean that the cumulonimbus formations that pose a risk are easily detectable.

Aircraft will divert or change their flight level to avoid threatening systems, while pilots have ample time to activate seatbelt signs and warn passengers.

More problematic is so-called clear air turbulence, or what used to be described as a “rough patch or air”. Striking in a cloudless sky, it sends drinks slopping, bellies lurching and has passengers staggering in the aisles – or worse.

This is often encountered along the flanks of mountain ranges, where air is forced rapidly higher, but can also be experienced in cloudless air affected by distant storm systems.

Changes in wind speeds associated with aircraft moving in and out of jet streams in the upper atmosphere are also a trigger.

It may be that the straying of jet streams further from the poles as the climate warms is even to blame for the increase in cases of turbulence.

A preliminary report into the Singapore Airlines incident found that the Boeing 777 encountered an updraft, after which it lurched up and down in less than five seconds, experiencing huge gravitational swings that caused those who weren’t strapped in to become airborne.

Briton Geoff Kitchen, 73, subsequently died from a heart attack and 58 people were admitted to hospital, 20 of them to intensive care.

The report didn’t specify the nature of the turbulence encountered, but, given that seatbelt signs weren’t initially illuminated, the pilots appear to have had very little warning.

Quite how much the threat from turbulence has increased is not entirely clear. Iata was not able to supply data on people hurt by turbulence, but says it is the biggest cause of in-cabin injuries, alongside burns from hot drinks and strains from lifting heavy bags.

The US Federal Aviation Administration lists 163 injuries as having been caused by turbulence in the 10 years to 2022, with the majority suffered by cabin crew and only 34 by passengers – fewer than the number hospitalised in the Singapore Airlines case.

At Emirates, however, Sir Tim says the trend has been clear for some time, and well in advance of the Singapore flight.

He said: “Well before that there was evidence that we were beginning to see a ticking up of the amount of turbulence. People say it’s climate change, some people say it’s because we’ve got many more flights than we used to have. But the fact is the incidence is going up.”

Sir Tim said that passengers will definitely see an increase in warnings flashing up on seat-back screens, and a propensity for pilots to be more proactive in feeding information to cabin crew and travellers.

Attendees flying to the Iata meeting with Emirates were regularly reminded about the virtues of buckling up, while seat-belt signs flashed on at the slightest sign of bumpy air.

At the same time, in-flight displays continued to extol the virtues of a mid-flight stroll (said to guard against the risk of deep vein thrombosis), and the sight of parents leading a bored toddler around the cavernous cabin of an A380 superjumbo remained as common as ever.

Iata is banking on its Turbulence Aware initiative, launched in 2018, to help alert carriers to the location of turbulent air pockets.

While only 21 of the group’s 330 members have so far signed up to the platform, which uses data from thousands of flights to provide real-time information on optimal flight paths, it says there has been a surge of interest following the Singapore incident.

Sir Tim Clark said real-time data is all well and good, but that airlines really need advance information on where turbulence might occur.

Artificial intelligence able to provide forecasts based on an analysis of weather patterns and the jet stream may hold the key.

He said: “We’re trying to use a bit of AI to give us a predictive analytic capability with regard to where turbulence is, but it’s very difficult.”

Whether turbulence is more common may be a matter of debate. But the warning to buckle up midway through a journey seems likely to become increasingly common."
Pilots at Irish airline Aer Lingus vote on industrial action,"Pilots at Aer Lingus are balloting for industrial action in a dispute over pay, the Irish Air Lines Pilots’ Association (IALPA) said on Wednesday, while the Irish airline dismissed the action as ""entirely unnecessary.""

The ballot follows the rejection by pilots of an Irish Labour Court recommendation that would have increased pilot pay by 9.25%, the union said. The union said it was recommending that members vote in favour of industrial action, ""up to and including strike action,"" in a vote that will run until June 12.

Aer Lingus, part of the IAG group, which also owns British Airways and Iberia, said it was surprised that IALPA had initiated the ballot before meeting directly with the airline. In a statement the airline said pilots were looking for a pay increase of 27%.

IALPA said some measures introduced by management during the COVID pandemic have not been reversed. Pilots last received a pay increase in July 2019 while data showed Irish workers on average had received an increase of 24% in that period, the union said."
Should Value Investors Buy International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAGY) Stock?,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.

Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.

Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.

One stock to keep an eye on is International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAGY). ICAGY is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.

Investors should also recognize that ICAGY has a P/B ratio of 1.56. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.46. Over the past 12 months, ICAGY's P/B has been as high as 1.89 and as low as 1.54, with a median of 1.75.

Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. ICAGY has a P/S ratio of 0.13. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.37.

These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that International Consolidated Airlines Group is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, ICAGY feels like a great value stock at the moment.

3 Airline Stocks to Bet On Post IATA's Bullish 2024 View,"The stronger-than-expected recovery of air travel demand following the end of the pandemic is supporting growth of the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry. While air travel demand is particularly strong on the leisure front, it is heartening to note that business demand has made an impressive comeback.

Passenger volumes are likely to move further northward in the summer season. Per Airlines for America, U.S. airlines are anticipated to carry 271 million passengers from Jun 1 to Aug 31, 2024. The projection marks an all-time high.

The latest positive update on this key industry is the bullish projection for 2024 by the International Air Transport Association or IATA despite the existing economic uncertainties. The uptick in passenger volumes contributed to IATA’s increased current-year forecast for net profits compared with 2023 actuals. Given the positivity surrounding the industry, we believe betting on airline stocks like Copa Holdings CPA, SkyWest SKYW and International Consolidated Airlines Group ICAGY is a prudent move.

IATA’s FY24 Forecast in Detail
Owing to the buoyant air travel demand scenario, IATA now expects the industry to generate a net profit of $30.5 billion in 2024 compared with $25.7 billion estimated in December last year. Net profit in 2023 was $27.4 billion. The top line in 2024 is now anticipated to be $996 billion compared with the previous estimate of $964 billion. The revised revenue forecast, a record high, indicates a 9.7% increase from the 2023 actuals.

Passenger revenues are the biggest driver of the rosy projection for 2024. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2024 are now anticipated to be $744 billion compared with the previous estimate of $717 billion. The revised revenue forecast indicates a 15.2% increase from the 2023 actuals. Per IATA, a record 4.96 billion people are likely to take to the skies in 2024.

Cargo revenues in 2024 are expected to be $120 billion, which, though lower than the 2023 actuals of $138 billion are still $19 billion higher than the 2019 actuals. The current forecast for cargo revenues also compares favorably with the earlier projection of $111 billion provided in 2023.

Total costs in the current year are projected to be $936 billion, 9.4% higher than the 2023 actuals due to high fuel costs. Per IATA, the average jet fuel cost is expected to be $113.8 per barrel in 2024. The total fuel bill in 2024 is expected to be $291 billion, higher than the previous estimate of $281 billion. The current projection for the 2024 fuel bill implies that fuel expenses account for 31% of total operating costs.

Driven by higher revenues, operating profit for the industry is now estimated to be $59.9 billion in 2024, well above the previous estimate of $49.3 billion. The current operating profit forecast also compares favorably with the 2023 actual.

On a region-wise basis, North American carriers are expected to be the major contributors to the current-year net profit projection. They are expected to reap net profits of $14.8 billion or $13.1 per passenger this year. Reflecting the improved air travel demand scenario, passenger demand this year is likely to grow 7% year over year. European carriers are expected to reap net profits of $9 billion. The performance of carriers in regions like Latin America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific is also likely to improve, mainly owing to higher passenger volumes.

3 Airline Stocks to Bet On Now
Given this encouraging backdrop, we believe airline stocks should grace one’s portfolio for healthy returns. Below, we present three airline stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Moreover, the following companies have witnessed favorable earnings estimate revisions for the current year.

Latin American carrier Copa Holdings is being aided by upbeat air travel demand. We are also encouraged by Copa Holdings' initiatives to modernize its fleet.

Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CPA’s 2024 earnings has been revised 3.6% upward. Copa Holdings currently sports a Zacks Rank #1."
British Airways passengers to get Amazon-style booking app,"British Airways passengers are to get Amazon-style app booking where flights can be secured in just a few clicks in an overhaul of the company’s decades-old website.

The company’s app and website are to be relaunched as part of a £7bn revamp under BA’s chief executive Sean Doyle as he scrambles to modernise the flag carrier.

Changes will also include new planes, revamped seats and refurbished airport lounges.

The replacement website is already being trialled by people wishing to fly from London Gatwick to three Italian cities – Bari, Cagliari and Catania – plus Montpellier in France and Antalya, Turkey.

Feedback has been positive, giving BA confidence to go ahead with a full rollout, Mr Doyle told The Telegraph at the International Air Transport Association airline summit in Dubai.

He said: “We’ve done upgrades before, but this one is very different. It’s embracing technology in a way we haven’t done since the dot.com boom and looking ahead at future proofing the business.

“The website’s been around for 22 years. We were leaders in it many years ago and we’d improved it down through the years. But we’ve been falling behind and we need to catch up and leapfrog the rest. So we’ve scrapped the old one and built a new one from the start.

“You’ll begin to see the new one rolled out for the customer as we get into the second half. It’s simple and easy to use, the resilience is better and it’s more convenient.”

Sean Doyle

Mr Doyle said the upgrade will seek to take an “omni-channel” approach, with people getting the same familiar experience via the new app, on BA.com, or when viewing the website on their mobile phone.

The aim will be to match the convenience of the “three clicks and you can check out” approach of online retailing pioneered by the likes of Amazon, he said.

People taking a family holiday are likely to continue to use the website, but the app should become the primary resource for those making regular trips, such as business travellers.

Mr Doyle said: “The most important thing about an app is that the repeatable processes, that people rely on time and time and time again, work well.”

The digital upgrade will also allow travellers to undertake every single transaction online, compared with about 70pc today, he said. That will include the ability to rebook, claim a refund and cancel flights.

British Airways will seek to avoid the pitfalls experienced by US ally American Airlines, where a new system aimed at maximising direct bookings and reducing reliance on intermediaries generated less revenue than expected owing to its complexity.

The slip-up, which hurt late bookings from corporate travellers, sent American Airlines shares down 16pc last Wednesday and led to the exit of its chief commercial officer.

In tandem with the digital makeover, British Airways is upgrading inflight entertainment, introducing a new cabin in its fleet of Airbus A320-series short-haul planes, its workhorse on European routes, and opening new airport lounges in Dubai, Miami, Lagos and Seattle.

A revamped first-class cabin will also be introduced on BA’s A380 superjumbos later this year, while about half of the value of the modernisation plan, or £3.5bn, will be spent on new planes.


BA has also boosted the workforce at its London Heathrow hub by 400 people compared with 2019 in an effort to reduce flight delays.

Mr Doyle said: “We’re putting in a lot of resource and implementing a new model there which is really beginning to drive an improvement in punctuality and operational resilience.”

The airline is also deploying AI in an effort to improve the efficiency of its maintenance operations, by helping to more accurately predict when planes will develop issues requiring a shop visit. This means parts can be ordered well in advance, minimising downtime.

BA has completed 200 of 600 modernisation initiatives it set itself in March, covering areas including revenue generation, customer and employee satisfaction, costs and sustainability."
Spain fines budget airlines €150m over ‘abusive’ cabin bag and seat charges,"Budget airlines including easyJet and Ryanair have been hit with fines totalling €150m (£128m) by the Spanish government for policies that include charging passengers extra for cabin luggage.

In the biggest sanction issued by the Spanish government’s ministry of social rights and consumer affairs, the carriers easyJet, Ryanair, Vueling and Volotea have been penalised after an investigation launched last summer.

Under the judgment, the four airlines face being banned from charging passengers for cabin luggage in the future.

The Spanish news outlet Cadena SER reported that the fines would total €150m, with the airlines also being censured for charging passengers extra fees to reserve adjacent seats for children and other dependents.

The Spanish Airline Association (ALA), which represents the airlines, has hit back at the decision, calling the fines “disproportionate”, and pointing out that airlines could still appeal.

Ministry sources told the Guardian that the general directorate of consumer affairs had opened up an investigation in June last year after complaints by consumer organisations over “abusive practices” being deployed by the airlines.

The investigation focused on four areas, which included charging extra for cabin luggage and seat selection.

The government investigation also looked at concerns around a lack of transparency by the airlines over the final price of services when booking online, and the decision to block cash payments at the airport for additional services.

The sources said that the final sanction proposals had been put forward to the affected companies weeks ago. The ministry would not confirm the financial amounts each company has been asked to pay.

Cadena SER also reported that Ryanair had been censured by the ministry for charging passengers €20 to print off their paper tickets, calling this a disproportionate cost.

Facua, one of the consumer groups that filed the initial complaint, welcomed the decision, saying that it had been campaigning for six years to get the government to intervene.

ALA, which represents airlines carrying 85% of air traffic to and from Spain, said in a statement that the process was still open and an appeal could be lodged.

It also stressed that the practice was completely legal and that European legislation recognised the freedom of airlines to set their fares.

It said: “Sanctioning this practice limits the option to pay only for essential services and would force all passengers to contract the cabin baggage transport service, even if they do not need it.

“The consumer will be the main victim of this interference by the ministry of social rights, consumer affairs and Agenda 2030 in the European single market and the freedom of tariffs protected by European law.”

Ryanair, Vueling and easyJet referred the Guardian to the ALA for a response. Volotea has been contacted for comment."
"Ryanair, Easyjet and others fined for cabin luggage fees","Spanish authorities have slapped fines on budget airlines Ryanair, easyJet, Vueling and Volotea totalling 150 million euros ($163 million), consumer groups who lead a six-year campaign against the charges said on Friday.

The fines are a challenge to budget airlines' business models, which hinge on charging rock-bottom fees for tickets and adding supplements for things like larger carry-on bags that were previously provided free by traditional airlines.

Spain's Consumer Rights Ministry fined the carriers for violating customer rights when charging for larger carry-on luggage, picking seats or boarding pass printouts, while not allowing cash payments at check-in desks or to buy items on-board, said consumer rights associations OCU and Facua which have been challenging the practices since 2018.

The ministry opened an investigation in 2023.

OCU said in a statement it expected other European countries to follow suit and also to punish those same ""abusive practices.""

Spanish airlines industry group ALA, which confirmed the fines, was quick to criticise the government decision as violating the European Union's single market rules and the companies' freedom to set their own prices.

""We defend the consumer's right to pick the best travel option,"" ALA President Javier Gandara said in a statement, adding that Spain's decision would force as many as 50 million passengers who only travel with a small bag under their seat to pay for services they do not require.

The Consumer Rights Ministry had no immediate comment. Ryanair, Volotea and Vueling declined to comment on the fine since ALA spoke on their behalf.

In 2019, a Spanish court ruled Ryanair's policy of charging a fee for hand luggage was ""abusive"". However, Ryanair continued with its policy, citing airlines' commercial freedom to determine the size of their cabin baggage.

The success of the budget airlines and the appeal of their low-ticket price policy has forced many legacy airlines to stop offering services such as free food and drinks or entertainment in short- and medium-haul flights."
"Questor: Emotions aside, British Airways’ owner is a grossly undervalued stock","It can be extremely difficult to ignore personal feelings towards a company when judging its investment potential.

A positive previous experience with a firm can, for example, lead an investor to conclude that it represents a worthwhile buying opportunity without first determining its financial strength, intrinsic value or competitive advantage.

Conversely, a poor personal experience can mean a company is deemed off-limits by an investor even if it offers a wide margin of safety, has a solid balance sheet and provides clear long-term growth potential.

Both situations can lead to disappointing returns compared with an investor who is able to put their emotions towards a company to one side when apportioning capital.

Indeed, the notion that one person’s experience can ever be sufficiently comprehensive to judge an entire company’s investment appeal is, in Questor’s view, optimistic at best.

With that in mind, investors should put aside their past experiences with British Airways when deciding whether shares in its owner, IAG, have long-term appeal.

A large proportion of UK-based investors are likely to have flown with British Airways at some point in their lives.

Some people may have had positive experiences, others less so. The key takeaway in this column’s view, though, is that the company’s investment fundamentals remain sound.

Its recently released first-quarter results showed a continued improvement in performance.

The company’s operating profit rose from €9m in the first quarter of last year to €68m in the same period of this year.

Passenger numbers rose by 8.6pc year-on-year, with passenger capacity increasing by 7pc and passenger load factor up by 1.6 percentage points to 83.1pc.

Passenger yield, meanwhile, was 2.4pc higher than in the same period of the previous year.

This impressive performance highlights an improvement in the company’s operating conditions, with it reporting strong demand across its variety of airlines.

This is unsurprising, since the economy’s outlook has significantly strengthened over recent months.

Annual inflation in the UK, for example, has fallen by 640 basis points in the past year so that it now stands at a relatively modest 2.3pc.

This puts less pressure on disposable incomes, thereby providing consumers with greater scope for spending on discretionary items such as air travel.

Indeed, global passenger demand rose by almost 14pc in March, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

It forecasts that worldwide passenger numbers will increase by over 10pc this year and by a further 9pc next year as the industry finally surpasses pre-Covid levels of performance.

IAG, as well as the broader airline industry, is also set to benefit from interest rate cuts that are moving ever closer.

They should not only stimulate the economy, but prompt investors to rethink their somewhat cautious stance towards perceived risky, cyclical companies such as airlines.

Indeed, shares in British Airways’ owner currently trade on a price-to-earnings ratio of just four.

This suggests they offer an exceptionally wide margin of safety that could equate to significant capital growth over the coming years.

In tandem, the company’s overall risk is falling. In its latest quarterly update, it reported that net debt had declined by 20pc so that it now stands at €7.4bn.


Net finance costs, meanwhile, were covered nearly five times by operating profits in the latest financial year.

And with total liquidity amounting to €13.3bn, the firm is well placed to overcome any further industry-related challenges in the future.

Although non-fuel unit costs rose by 3.7pc year-on-year in its latest quarter, this was in line with expectations and was partly due to increased investment in the company’s customer offering.

Fuel unit costs, in contrast, declined by 4.9pc versus the same quarter of the previous year.

Since first being tipped by Questor in February 2021, IAG’s shares have produced a rather disappointing 5pc capital gain.

However, the company is well placed to benefit from improved operating conditions, prompted by falling inflation and interest rate cuts, that should lead to continued growth in its profits.

Its dirt-cheap market valuation suggests that there is significant scope for share price gains, while its improving financial strength means lower risk for investors.

Therefore, irrespective of any positive or negative personal feelings towards British Airways or any of the company’s other airlines, IAG remains a worthwhile long-term investment on a risk/reward basis."
M&S chairman hits out at British Airways after string of flights cancelled,"The chairman of Marks & Spencer has hit out at British Airways, saying it was “sad to see a great airline deteriorate” after a series of flight issues.

Archie Norman criticised the company in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, claiming his flight had been “cancelled then delayed” for the third time this year. He later deleted his post.

However, Mr Norman’s assessment is likely to rankle given the M&S chairman’s stature in the business world. The City grandee is renowned for turning around underperforming businesses. He is credited with a revival at Asda while chief executive in the 1990s and is overseeing the current improvement at M&S.

His criticism of BA came as the airline faced disruption on Friday morning caused by bad weather. 

A spokesman for British Airways said: “Like all airlines, due to restrictions imposed by Air Traffic Control at Heathrow Airport as a result of poor visibility, we’ve made some adjustments to our schedule.

“We’ve apologised to our customers for the disruption to their travel plans and our teams are working to get them to their destinations as quickly as possible.”

Mr Norman is the latest high-profile figure to complain of issues with the airline.

Last August, Sir Ian Rankin - the award-winning crime writer - claimed he was downgraded from business class to economy on a “once-in-a-lifetime” trip with British Airways. Writing on X, Mr Rankin wrote: “Traveller beware.”

Broadcaster Terry Christian responded to say the incident was a “bad show indeed”, adding: “Airlines aren’t even particularly apologetic about this stuff either in my experience.”

Recent figures showed BA was one of the UK’s worst for delays and cancellations.


Almost 3pc of BA flights were cancelled last year, according to data from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and analysts OAG. By contrast, Ryanair cancelled 0.34pc of flights and easyJet 1.5pc of flights.

British Airways flights had an average delay of 22.3 minutes in 2023, compared to 21.5 minutes for easyJet and 19.8 minutes for Ryanair.

It has sparked growing frustration among flyers. A survey by Which? in February revealed that the airline ranked among the worst for customer satisfaction.

For long-haul flights, British Airways’ customer satisfaction store was the joint third lowest out of the 17 carriers, only above Air Canada and Lufthansa. For short-haul, it was the fifth lowest, with a satisfaction score of 56pc.

Rory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said: “Air fares have soared in recent years, and the bare minimum passengers should expect in return for their hard-earned cash is a reliable service, with friendly, easy to access customer support when they are let down.”

He said passengers at many airlines were “sadly being shortchanged - with high rates of last minute cancellations, abysmal customer service and sneaky extra fees for luggage hiking up the final price”.

At the time British Airways apologised for any disruption customers had faced during challenging periods, saying it always worked hard “to get our customers to where they need to be on time”.

BA suffered a series of technical issues last year, including an IT outage last May that caused severe travel turmoil during the bank holiday weekend. At the time, the carrier was forced to cancel more than 175 flights.

BA boss Sean Doyle recently claimed the airline was becoming more punctual at its London Heathrow hub, after improvements within the airport. He said 79pc of services were now on time, compared to 60pc a year ago.

British Airways’s owner IAG has predicted a boom in demand this summer. IAG chief Luis Gallego said last week: “Bookings are good. Demand continues to be strong and we’re well positioned for the summer.”"

"Working from home hurting corporate travel, warns British Airways owner","British Airways parent IAG has said an increase in home working since Covid is holding back demand for corporate travel, even as it predicts a bumper summer for leisure sales.

The airline giant warned that Britain has seen a slower rebound in business travel compared to other countries, which has left BA lagging behind rivals overseas in the race to restore corporate bookings.

IAG boss Luis Gallego said on Friday that he expects corporate travel to settle at around 85pc of its pre-Covid capacity, reflecting changes to working practices and the increased use of online meetings.

Volumes at Spanish carrier Iberia have already reached that threshold, he said, while BA’s corporate bookings are just 70pc of what they were before 2020.

Specifically, Mr Gallego pointed to weaker demand from finance and pharmaceutical companies.

He said: “It’s different in Spain. In Spain, people came back to work before and they have less remote working.”

By contrast, he said the British corporate travel market is “going to take some more time” to bounce back but is “evolving well”.

Around 90pc of UK companies now offer hybrid working to employees, who spend an average of 1.5 days at home each week, according to data from the IFO Institute.

That compares with an average of one day for counterparts in Germany, and 0.6 in France.

This has led to a number of white collar companies taking steps to downsize offices over the past year, as staff are increasingly reluctant to give up remote working.

However, IAG’s latest figures reveal that the drop-off in corporate travel does not necessarily mean people are avoiding the priciest fares, as there has been a surge in leisure bookings across first and business-class cabins.

Occupancy levels in premium berths on BA’s North Atlantic flights reached a record 74pc in the first quarter.

Meanwhile, demand for flights to and from Asia, once an important source of long-haul revenue for European carriers, remains low.

Flights in the Far East accounted for just 3.7pc of IAG’s capacity in the quarter, which is less than half of what it was before Covid. That is despite most destinations in the Asia-Pacific region being restored.

Overall, IAG posted operating profits of €68m (£58.5m) from January to March, up from €9m a year earlier. Of that, BA contributed £22m.

Summer demand across the group appears buoyant, Mr Gallego said: “Bookings are good. Demand continues to be strong and we’re well positioned for the summer.”

A busy summer has already led to British Airways adding 1,700 people to its workforce, taking its total number of employees to 36,000.

BA boss Sean Doyle said he’s encouraged by the carrier’s improved punctuality at its London Heathrow hub, with 79pc of services on time in the quarter, up from just 60pc a year ago.

That’s largely down to improvements at the airport itself, he said.

IAG added that it is still aiming to close the purchase of Spanish carrier Air Europa before the end of the year, while it also still considering a bid for TAP Air Portugal.

Adding TAP would bring access to more cities in Brazil, though Gallego has said he will need to see the terms first before deciding whether to get involved."
"Bank of England made ‘persistent and systematic’ errors, official admits","The Bank of England made “persistent and systematic” errors in its forecasts about inflation, one of its policymakers has said.

Swati Dhingra, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, was one of two officials to vote for a reduction in interest rates from 5.25pc to 5pc on Thursday. In the event, rates were kept on hold.

Ms Dhingra was speaking at a conference hosted by King’s College London following former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke’s review into the Bank of England’s forecasting errors.

Inflation surged to 11.1pc in October 2022, leading the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 16-year highs.

Ms Dhingra said: “At the end of the day even these statistical models will systematically over predict or under predict ... when a turning point comes they are going to do exactly the opposite.

“Even the best forecasting models, they will always have inherent and some level of uncertainty and inaccuracy.”

Her comments come as the Bank of England’s chief economist warned about the risk of being “seduced” by data showing a slowdown in inflation after his boss said interest rate cuts will be needed soon.

Huw Pill, who voted for interest rates to remain at 5.25pc, said the Monetary Policy Committee which sets rates must make sure “that we ensure that inflation is at target on a lasting and sustainable basis”.

Mr Pill was speaking a day after Governor Andrew Bailey said that interest rate cuts will be needed and could happen faster than markets anticipate.

It comes as Britain exited recession with faster-than-expected growth at the start of the year.

Money markets traders are currently betting that there is a 60pc chance of a rate cut happening in June.

Inflation has fallen to 3.2pc and Mr Bailey said that the Bank believes inflation may already be at its 2pc target following a drop in the energy price cap.

European shares close at record high amid rate cut optimism
Europe’s main stock index closed at a record high on Friday - just like the FTSE 100 - and is on track for its biggest weekly gain since late January. It came amid growing bets on interest rate cuts across the continent and a strong earnings season.

The pan-European Stoxx 600, which includes UK businesses such as Vodafone and BAE Systems, ended 0.7pc higher, with indexes in major economies Germany and France finishing at record highs.

European shares have resumed their record-breaking rally, with the Stoxx 600 notching a 3pc weekly gain, after investors took a breather in April.

The euphoria around artificial intelligence and monetary policy easing, among others, had sparked bumper gains in the region’s stocks since late 2023.

Highlighting Europe’s divergence from the US Federal Reserve and boosting equities, the Bank of England hinted at summer rate cuts and Sweden’s Riksbank delivered its first cut since 2016 earlier this week.

Minutes from the ECB’s April policy meeting showed that policymakers favoured kicking off the monetary policy easing cycle in June, while remaining confident that inflation is on track to fall back to 2pc next year."
IAG in talks to address Air Europa bid concerns,"British Airways owner IAG said on Friday it is in talks with other airlines about ceding routes in order to address EU regulators' concerns that its bid for Air Europa may reduce competition and lead to price increases.

IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, aims to secure full control of Air Europa, but the European Commission last month warned about the impact on Spanish domestic routes as well as long-haul routes.

""Regarding Air Europa's acquisition, we continue to make progress with the European Commission and have already shared with them the potential airlines that would take over the routes renounced as part of the remedy package,"" IAG said in a statement in a call with Spanish media outlets.

It added that ""as shared before, we have received a lot of interest from different carriers and are working with Avianca, Binter, Iberojet, Ryanair, Volotea, and World2Fly as potential remedy takers both on long-haul and short-haul routes"".

IAG has until June 10 to submit remedies.

In February 2023, IAG said it had agreed to pay 400 million euros ($430.84 million) to Spanish tourism company Globalia for the 80% of Air Europa it did not already own in a bid to improve its Latin American market share, expand into Asia and allow its Madrid hub to compete with other major airports in Europe.

IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego told analysts on Friday after reporting first-quarter earnings that the group could pull the plug on its bid for Air Europa if conditions demanded by regulators prove too cumbersome, but he said that IAG wasn't yet at that point."

Rio “management had not ruled out making a play for part or all of the mining group and continued to study the day-to-day situation"", the Australian Financial Review reported.

Anglo has turned down BHP’s proposal, saying it was opportunistic and significantly undervalued the British company. Under the UK’s takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a formal offer.

“Shares in Anglo American are up on a report that Rio Tinto also considered a bid following BHP’s rejected offer. M&A speculation is helping to keep Anglo shares supported at the moment,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.

BHP and Rio have a close working relationship at Escondida and Resolution Copper. One option for Rio is to informally assist BHP’s bid for Anglo by acquiring the assets that BHP does not want, such as Anglo’s diamond business, AFR wrote.

Glencore is also studying options for a possible approach for Anglo, Reuters reported earlier in the month, a move that could spark a bidding war.

Total revenues also jumped to €6.4bn (£5.5bn), up from €5.9bn (£5.1bn) last year, while fuel costs were about 5% lower than the previous year, due to lower average prices and more efficient aircraft deliveries.

IAG said the improved profits and sales had been driven by stronger demand across its airlines, which also include Iberia and Vueling.

It also highlighted that it was continuing to see a rebound in leisure travel."
British Airways owner IAG sees profits soar as fuel costs cool,"The owner of airlines British Airways and Aer Lingus has said its earnings have soared in recent months thanks to higher sales and lower fuel costs.

International Airlines Group (IAG) said it was continuing to see a rebound in leisure travel.

It reported an operating profit for the first three months of the year of 68 million euro (£58.5 million), up from the nine million euro (£7.7 million) reported this time last year.

Total revenues also jumped to 6.4 billion euro (£5.5 billion), up from 5.9 billion euro (£5.1 billion) last year.

IAG said the improved profits and sales had been driven by stronger demand across its airlines, which also include Iberia and Vueling.

It highlighted demand for travel between major European cities, particularly for leisure, while business travel has recovered more slowly.

But conflict in the Middle East affected flying by most of its airlines to the region.

Fuel costs were about 5% lower than the previous year, due to lower average prices and more efficient aircraft deliveries, IAG said.

But it still spent more on operating the business over the latest quarter because of the higher volume of flights.

It also said employee costs jumped by more than 14% year on year, due to staff wages being pushed up and hiring more staff for a busy summer schedule.

Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, said: “Our transformation initiatives and increased demand, including over the Easter holidays, have delivered another very good set of results with improvements to both revenue and operating profit.

“Our group benefits from the strength of our core markets – North Atlantic, South Atlantic and intra-Europe – and the performance of our brands.

“We are well-positioned for the summer. The high demand for travel is a continuing trend.”"
BA-owner IAG projects strong summer after solid first quarter,"British Airways owner IAG reported a surge in first quarter earnings on Friday helped by rising demand over the Easter holiday and said it was seeing strong summer bookings.

Chief Executive Luis Gallego said the group, which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling airlines, had already secured more than 80% of projected bookings for the second quarter and over 40% for the third quarter.

IAG's exposure to the Middle East was very small so it hadn't seen a big impact from the conflict there, he said.

Shares in IAG rose 1.4% by 0815 GMT after the group said operating profit totalled 68 million euros ($73 million) in January-March.

That topped analysts' forecasts of 49 million euros, according to a company-compiled consensus, and compared with a profit of just 9 million euros in the same quarter of last year.

""Our transformation initiatives and increased demand, including over the Easter holidays, have delivered another very good set of results with improvement to both revenue and operating profit,"" Gallego said in a statement.

The first quarter is often weak for airlines, with fewer bookings at the start of the year.

Investors said IAG's first quarter performance showed the strength of its long-haul traffic and its success in reducing debt built up during the pandemic when airports and borders shut and planes were grounded.

RIVALS STRUGGLE

European rivals Lufthansa and Air France-KLM reported worse than expected first quarters as they struggled with a range of issues.

""Lufthansa had strikes which was the big problem. Air France-KLM had some one-offs, but IAG was still better. IAG is the higher-margin group anyway: double digit margins vs single digits at the others in general,"" Bernstein analyst Alex Irving said.

Gallego pointed to the group's smaller exposure to Asia, where traffic has recovered slowly, compared to rival European airline groups and to particularly strong results in its core markets like Southern Europe.

However, Gallego also said IAG could pull the plug on its takeover bid for Spain's Air Europa if conditions demanded by regulators prove too cumbersome, but told analysts on a call that the group wasn't yet at that point.

EU antitrust regulators warned in April that IAG's bid to secure full control of Air Europa may reduce competition and lead to price increases.

In its statement, IAG said it expected slightly higher costs this year, but that it saw 7% growth in passenger capacity in 2024.

Airlines have complained that delayed deliveries from planemakers will further constrain capacity and limit their ability to meet record demand this year.

IAG said its non-fuel unit costs increased by 3.7% in January-March from a year earlier, driven by investments in the business and the impact of wage settlements agreed in 2023."

Key Insights
International Consolidated Airlines Group's estimated fair value is UK£1.87 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Current share price of UK£1.77 suggests International Consolidated Airlines Group is potentially trading close to its fair value

Analyst price target for IAG is €2.28, which is 22% above our fair value estimate

How far off is International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (LON:IAG) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

See our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group

Step By Step Through The Calculation
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €6.3b

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.8%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €1.2b× (1 + 1.8%) ÷ (11%– 1.8%) = €13b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €13b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= €4.4b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is €11b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK£1.8, the company appears about fair value at a 5.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.

The Assumptions
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Consolidated Airlines Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.707. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Next Steps:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

The airline giant stepping up the race for global dominance,"After a rocky few years, British Airways parent IAG is once again plotting its bid for global expansion.

With pandemic woes largely behind it, International Airlines Group (IAG) is aiming to tighten its grip on transatlantic travel with a bid for TAP Air Portugal – a deal that would boost access to Brazil’s market of 215 million people.

Bosses at IAG view TAP as the final element in a push to extend its lead over European rivals on routes to North and South America.

As a result, they are mulling participation in an upcoming auction after Portugal’s government put the flagship carrier back up for sale.

Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, said in March that he’d need to “see the conditions” attached to the sale before deciding on a bid, but admitted TAP presents an “opportunity” for the business.

European airline consolidation is at a critical juncture, with IAG also seeking to acquire Air Europa of Spain, Deutsche Lufthansa bidding for Alitalia successor ITA, and Air France-KLM pursuing Scandinavian Airlines.

Should the deals all clear regulatory hurdles and TAP also find a buyer, Finnair would be the only major flag carrier to sit outside the continent’s three consolidated airline groups.

IAG is already a leading player between Europe and the US via BA’s joint venture with American Airlines, while its Iberia unit is the biggest operator of services to Spanish-speaking parts of the Americas.

However, the company was formed with consolidation in mind, adopting a structure designed to make expansionary acquisitions easier.

TAP is particularly prized for the dozen or so routes it offers to Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy and a former Portuguese colony.

Portugal first approved the sale of a majority stake last September as demand rebounded from the pandemic, drawing immediate interest from IAG.

However, that plan was put on hold following the collapse of the socialist government in November.

Spanish IAG boss Luis Gallego must convince the Portuguese government that TAP's Lisbon hub won't be overshadowed by Madrid
Spanish IAG boss Luis Gallego must convince the Portuguese government that TAP's Lisbon hub won't be overshadowed by Madrid - Nick Morrish
Victory for the Democratic Alliance coalition in a March election has now returned TAP to the top of the political agenda, with its sale deemed a priority as the new administration seeks to reduce the national debt and balance budgets.

IAG is likely to face a tussle with Lufthansa and Air France-KLM for TAP, which also serves former Portuguese territories in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where British Airways, Iberia and their partners in the Oneworld airline alliance have a limited presence.

Gallego, a Spaniard, will need to convince the Portuguese government that TAP’s Lisbon hub won’t be overshadowed by Madrid, the main base for Iberia.

The Spanish carrier helped form the earliest version of IAG via a merger with British Airways in 2011.

This has since led to IAG being registered in Madrid, although its HQ is located near Heathrow at BA’s Waterside head office. The group’s largest shareholder is Qatar Airways, with the state-backed airline boasting a 25pc stake.

As part of any sale, Portugal will also be eager for TAP to maintain flights to key global destinations such as New York, which are seen as vital to the economy.

In making its pitch for the business, IAG is expected to indicate how it has expanded Aer Lingus’s Dublin hub as evidence of its willingness to see smaller bases grow alongside London Heathrow and Madrid, according to industry insiders.

Aer Lingus – which was bought by IAG in 2015 – and TAP both operate fleets of Airbus A321LR jets, a single-aisle model that can cross the Atlantic from their hubs in the west of Europe and is cheaper to operate than a wide-body plane.

John Strickland, an aviation consultant and former network planner at British Airways, said an IAG takeover of TAP would make sense, though there will be some concerns around Portugal’s actions in the wake of previous privatisation attempts.

IAG looked closely at bidding for TAP almost 15 years ago but the Portuguese airline was ultimately sold to a consortium led by JetBlue founder David Neeleman, only for it to be partially renationalised following a change of government.

It was later taken fully under state control to save it from collapse when Covid halted international travel.

Strickland said: “Potential investors will need to be absolutely convinced that there won’t be interference from the government or pressure to do this or that purely for political and national reasons.”

IAG is also hoping to close the €400m purchase of Iberia rival and transatlantic specialist Air Europa
IAG is also hoping to close the €400m purchase of Iberia rival and transatlantic specialist Air Europa - BORJA SUAREZ/REUTERS
IAG, which reports quarterly earnings on Friday, is separately working to close its €400m purchase of Air Europa, a rival to Iberia in Madrid and another trans-Atlantic specialist.

This comes after the European Commission said in April that it views the deal as likely to restrict competition and push up prices for travel both within Spain and on long-haul routes.

IAG says the takeover would give it about 64pc of long-haul flights from Madrid, putting it on a par with Air France’s position in Paris and that of Lufthansa in Frankfurt.

Given the scrutiny, IAG will need to give up more slots and routes to secure approval for the transaction.

Separately, policymakers in Brussels have also extended the deadline for a decision on Lufthansa’s €325m acquisition of a 41pc stake in ITA Airways, Italy’s state carrier.

The German airline must again sweeten a package of proposed remedies to win approval.

As for the bloc’s third pending deal, Air France-KLM is awaiting the EU’s response to its November agreement to take a 20pc stake in Scandinavian Airlines as part of a $1.2bn transaction that also involves the Danish government.

SAS said it expects the investment to trigger some antitrust recommendations, though nothing that might upset the plan.

Finnair, once touted as another potential IAG target, remains independent after the closure of Russian airspace upended its strategy of feeding traffic from East Asia into Europe via Helsinki.

In terms of IAG’s finances, British Airways remains the main driver of earnings after generating just short of half of the company’s €3.5bn in operating profits last year.

Resurgent revenues since Covid – hitting €29.45bn in 2023 – have also been aided by Iberia and Aer Lingus, while the group also owns Barcelona-based discount carrier Vueling.

It is this strength in numbers that IAG hope will be enough to convince the Portuguese government of a prospective sale, which would propel the airline giant back towards its original goal of global expansion."
"Airbus says deliveries up 13% in April, reaffirms A350F timeline","Airbus delivered 61 aircraft in April, up 13% from the same month of 2023, bringing deliveries so far this year to 203, the European planemaker said on Tuesday.

An unidentified airline ordered 51 A321neo jets during the month and British Airways owner IAG reshuffled five narrow-body planes within its group, Airbus monthly data showed.

So far this year, the world's largest planemaker has sold 227 planes - or 222 after allowing for the conversions within the IAG airline group's order book.

Airbus meanwhile said there was no change in its target for entry to service of the A350 Freighter after a major leasing company questioned the development timeline.

Airbus said last year it was delaying the entry to service to 2026 from 2025. It also said separately that it was increasing the size of the plane's main cargo loading door.

Air Lease Corp Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy told analysts on Monday the design change meant more time would be needed for certification, implying possible new delays.

""We believe, based on the information we've gotten from Airbus, that the programme will be delayed, because of the certification of this new configuration on the cargo door and its effect on the fuselage and the flooring and the structure of the airframe,"" he told analysts.

Airbus said there was no change to guidance last updated in April 2023. ""We confirm the EIS (entry into service) was adjusted to 2026 back in 2023,"" a spokesperson said.

An Airbus slide presented to media at the Singapore Airshow in February suggested the entry to service would be towards the latter half of 2026, with flight tests spanning the second half of 2025 and the first half of 2026."

"EU antitrust regulators warn IAG, Air Europa deal may reduce competition","EU antitrust regulators on Friday warned that British Airways owner IAG's bid to secure full control of Air Europa may reduce competition and lead to price increases.

The European Commission singled out the impact on Spanish domestic routes and short-haul and long-haul routes in a statement of objections to the companies, confirming a Reuters story earlier this month.

""The Commission is concerned that customers may face increased prices and/or decreased quality of services after the transaction,"" the EU competition watchdog said in a statement.

IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, is prepared to give up more than 40% of Air Europa's 2023 flights to other airlines to address the European Commission's concerns, IAG CEO Luis Gallego said in a statement.

""Likewise, we commit to ensuring that no route is operated exclusively by Iberia and Air Europa. We remain committed to closing this transaction as quickly as possible in 2024,"" he added.

A person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier that IAG was also ready to give feeder traffic, slots, planes, crew, maintenance, ground handling and existing customer bookings on all divested routes to rivals.

It is also prepared to give rivals acquiring its long-haul routes access to feeder traffic in Europe, the person said.

The package is the one submitted to the Commission in February but now modified with more capacity to be divested and other additions, the source said.

The Commission said IAG could submit remedies at any time of the proceedings until the remedy deadline, which is currently set for June 10 this year.

Air Europa, headquartered in Spain, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, constitute the airline division of Spanish tourism company Globalia."
Airlines with low-cost reputations ‘not always cheapest because of extras’,"Airlines that boast about low prices can be more expensive than their rivals when extra costs are added to headline fares, according to a new study.

British Airways was cheaper than Ryanair and Wizz Air on two out of three routes analysed, according to consumer group Which?

Researchers conducted a snapshot price analysis for the cheapest return flights from London airports to Malaga, Athens and Naples with Ryanair, Wizz Air, British Airways, Jet2 and easyJet booked in December 2023 for travel on weekends this month.

They included the price of taking a cabin bag as hand luggage.

The cost of seat selection was added for Ryanair and Wizz Air as a previous survey indicated they are the airlines least likely to automatically seat travel companions together.

The study found that while budget airlines often had the cheapest headline fares, Ryanair and Wizz Air failed to return the lowest price on any occasion when the cost of a cabin bag and seat selection – always included in British Airways and Jet2 fares – were taken into account.

British Airways was found to have the lowest total price for Naples flights, at £120.

That compares with £198 with Jet2, £185 with Wizz Air, £132 with Ryanair and £126 with easyJet.

British Airways was the second cheapest airline, behind easyJet, for Malaga flights, but the most expensive for trips to Athens.

Baggage and seat selection accounted for an average of £113 across the three routes with Wizz Air, £57 with Ryanair and £52 with easyJet.

Wizz Air’s cabin bag fee includes priority boarding.

Unavoidable hidden charges for online consumers – or “drip pricing” – is to be banned under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill progressing through Parliament.

Optional extras are not included in the legislation, but Which? believes fees for seat selection on flights should be covered.

Rory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said: “It’s easy to assume that budget airlines like Ryanair and Wizz Air are always the cheapest option.

“But if you want to sit next to your kids or take more than a few items of clothes with you, then you’ll increasingly find better prices elsewhere.

“Next time you’re booking a flight, look beyond the headline fare and factor in the cost of extras you need, before you book.”

A Ryanair spokesman said: “This is more fake news from Which?.

“Ryanair has the lowest fares of any airline in Europe and additional ancillary products, such as extra luggage, are entirely optional for customers.”

A spokeswoman for Wizz Air said its “average price” for cabin baggage and priority boarding is “much lower” than the one found by Which?

She went on: “As an ultra-low-cost carrier, we allow passengers to choose which services they wish to purchase so that we can offer the most affordable travel opportunities.

“Optional add-ons are not required to fly, and we believe that customers should be offered the choice and flexibility to choose the right products for them.”"
"International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) sheds UK£730m, company earnings and investor returns have been trending downwards for past five years","While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (LON:IAG) share price has gained 11% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 70%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.

Since International Consolidated Airlines Group has shed UK£730m from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics.

See our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group

In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During five years of share price growth, International Consolidated Airlines Group moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.

Revenue is actually up 1.5% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.

What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?
We've already covered International Consolidated Airlines Group's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for International Consolidated Airlines Group shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 49%, over the last 5 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.

A Different Perspective
It's good to see that International Consolidated Airlines Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.1% in the last twelve months. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 8% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

"Exclusive-EU warning to IAG over Air Europa deal imminent, sources say","British Airways owner IAG is set to get an EU antitrust warning about its bid to secure full control of Air Europa after its remedies failed to address EU antitrust concerns, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

EU antitrust regulators have not sought feedback from rivals and customers on remedies submitted by IAG in late February, indicating that these are insufficient to address their concerns, the people said.

The European Commission, which acts as the EU's competition enforcer, is due to issue a statement of objections to IAG around the end of April, setting out specific concerns that could lead to a veto of the deal if not addressed, the sources said.

The EU executive - which is scheduled to decide on the deal by July 15 - and IAG declined to comment.

Neither IAG nor the Commission has provided details of the remedies. However, other sources said they include ceding airport slots and routes, as well as offering access to planes to enable rivals to start operating these almost immediately.

IAG wants to buy the 80% of Air Europa it does not already own from Spain's Globalia. The two carriers abandoned a previous deal in 2021 after EU regulators indicated their remedies were insufficient to alleviate competition concerns."
Two planes at Heathrow Airport collide on the ground,"The wingtip of an empty Virgin Atlantic jet collided with a stationary British Airways airliner while being towed from a stand at London's Heathrow Airport on Saturday, the airlines said.

Heathrow, Britain's busiest airport, said no passenger injuries had been reported and it did not anticipate any ongoing impact to the airport's operations.

""Our aircraft is being assessed by our engineering teams and we have provided an alternative aircraft to limit the impact on our customers,"" British Airways said in a statement.

Virgin Atlantic said its empty Boeing 787-9 had just completed a flight and was being towed to another part of the airfield when the incident happened at Terminal 3.

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""We’ve commenced a full and thorough investigation and our engineering teams are performing maintenance checks on the aircraft, which for now has been taken out of service.”

The airline said there would be no disruption to its flying programme on Saturday.

Heathrow said it was working with emergency services and the two airlines in response to the incident."
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY)'s Technical Outlook is Bright After Key Golden Cross,"International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, ICAGY's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""

Considered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.

There are three stages to a golden cross. First, there must be a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out. Then, the stock's shorter moving average crosses over its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third stage is when a stock continues the upward momentum to higher prices.

A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.

ICAGY has rallied 21.3% over the past four weeks, and the company is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank at the moment. This combination indicates ICAGY could be poised for a breakout.

The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account ICAGY's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter. There have been 1 upwards revisions compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up as well.

With a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on ICAGY for more gains in the near future."
"If EPS Growth Is Important To You, International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) Presents An Opportunity","For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.

Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.

How Fast Is International Consolidated Airlines Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?
Investors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that International Consolidated Airlines Group's EPS went from €0.087 to €0.54 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.

It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. It's noted that International Consolidated Airlines Group's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. The good news is that International Consolidated Airlines Group is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 6.3 percentage points to 12%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.

Are International Consolidated Airlines Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
As a general rule, it's worth considering how much the CEO is paid, since unreasonably high rates could be considered against the interests of shareholders. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like International Consolidated Airlines Group, with market caps over €7.4b, is about €4.8m.

International Consolidated Airlines Group's CEO took home a total compensation package worth €3.5m in the year leading up to December 2023. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.

Should You Add International Consolidated Airlines Group To Your Watchlist?
International Consolidated Airlines Group's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This appreciable increase in earnings could be a sign of an upward trajectory for the company. What's more, the fact that the CEO's compensation is quite reasonable is a sign that the company is conscious of excessive spending. So faced with these facts, it seems that researching this stock a little more may lead you to discover an investment opportunity that meets your quality standards. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted 2 warning signs for International Consolidated Airlines Group you should be aware of.

Air Europa says customer data may have been compromised in October breach,"Spanish airline Air Europa said on Friday personal data of its customers may have been compromised in a security incident that was detected in October last year.

The company's investigation showed that name, ID card or passport details, date of birth, telephone number, email address and nationality details could have been leaked, Air Europa told its customers in an email that was seen by Reuters.

Air Europa said the company immediately reported the situation to the authorities and costumers so they could take precautions.

""Air Europa continues to implement preventative measures in what is an ongoing process of security innovation given increasing incidents,"" it said.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news, but cited the statement to International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG).

IAG, which has a 20% stake in Air Europa, told Reuters that it ""would never email (Air Europa's) customers directly"".

Madrid-based Air Europa in October suffered a cyber attack on its online payment system that left some of its customers' credit card details exposed.

The carrier at the time said no other information was exposed without specifying the number of customers affected.

Last year, IAG agreed to pay 400 million euros ($434 million) to Spain's Globalia for the remaining 80% of airline Air Europa it did not already own. The deal has not closed, as it is being examined by competition regulators."
European airline CEOs say industry consolidation vital,"Airline executives called for further industry consolidation on Wednesday as the EU weighs a deal between Germany's Lufthansa and Italy's ITA Airways and hits pause on a separate transaction between IAG and Air Europa.

The European Commission should ""get on with it and approve these mergers because, ultimately, it is the way forward in Europe,"" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said at an industry event in Brussels.

He added there was a need to ""tidy up"" small-scale, struggling carriers in Europe, pointing to Portugal's TAP as requiring an ""unsustainable"" amount of taxpayer support to survive during the pandemic.

Others highlighted that smaller airlines have a much greater chance of success as part of larger groups, such as Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa.

British Airways to use robot baggage handlers at Gatwick,"British Airways and its parent company are to use self-driving robot baggage carriers at a UK airport for the first time as the aviation industry grapples with staff shortages.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), which owns BA, will deploy driverless baggage tugs at Gatwick and Cincinnati airports as soon as May, The Telegraph can reveal.

The autonomous vehicles will ferry baggage containers from terminal buildings to awaiting aircraft, where they will then be stowed using human-operated lifts.

BA has previously tested the vehicles at Heathrow Airport but they will now enter full-time service for the first time. Only one is expected to be deployed at Gatwick to begin with but the number could rise if the trial is successful.

The pioneering machines have been developed by Coventry-based Aurrigo, which has been testing its fleet at Changi Airport in Singapore since the pandemic.

Some come equipped with robot arms that can load and unload containers of baggage themselves. The tugs range in cost from about £100,000 to £250,000 each.

It is hoped the devices could improve efficiency, safety and aircraft turnaround times while also addressing staff shortages across the aviation industry since Covid, particularly in baggage handling.

Professor David Keene, Aurrigo’s chief executive, said: “You need 90pc less labour and equipment, so it is very efficient.

“Airlines want to be able to offer consistently good standards from a customer point of view as well. Often you’re in the airport building and it’s fantastic, you’re on the plane and it’s quite modern, but then you get off and it’s lotto time at the baggage carousel.

“First of all, you might have a long wait. Secondly, your bag might not have made it - and that really dents the customer experience.

“Everyone tends to blame the airline, because that’s who you’re flying with, but it’s not actually the airlines handling the bags in a lot of cases.

“So taking that back and being able to own the customer experience is a really important part of it.”

Professor Keene said the highly controlled nature of airports made them ideal places to deploy self-driving technology.

Other potential uses for the machines could include running shuttle buses from airport car parks or bus transfers for passengers between planes and airport terminals.

Steve McGowan, senior vice president for Airport Futures at IAG, said: “IAG is exploring innovative ways to help its airlines run their operations as smoothly and punctually as possible.

“We are working with Aurrigo to trial the use of autonomous baggage trollies, to help support the work of the fantastic baggage teams at our group airlines and our ground handling partners.”

Aurrigo was founded in 1993 by brothers David and Graham Keene and originally focused on parts for the car industry.

It is now branching out into autonomous vehicles, having developed its own robots and software with the help of UK government grants.

The London-listed company has set its sights on aviation because of the huge potential for robot baggage handling to be introduced at hundreds of airports around the world.

Using its software, Aurrigo creates a 3D “digital twin” of an airport, which is then used by the robots to learn local routes and navigate potential hazards.

Professor Keene said: “We’re now going to Schiphol [airport] in Holland, Munich and Stuttgart in Germany - they’re coming at us at a massive rate.”

He said the technology initially faced opposition from many labour unions but claimed this has recently eased."
Vueling airline owes us £969 but won’t pay up,"Can you help me get the £969 I am owed by Spanish airline Vueling. You really are my last hope.

In September 2022, we were due to fly from Gatwick to Barcelona, but the airline cancelled the flight while we were waiting to board. The whole thing was a nightmare and we ended up driving to Heathrow and paying more than £1,000 to get on a BA flight.

We also had to pay hundreds of pounds for a second lot of airport parking.

After a very long battle during which Vueling ignored our claim for denied boarding, the Civil Aviation Authority finally awarded us the money.

Despite this, the airline just refuses to pay up and continues to ignore us.

This situation has caused us huge distress and taken hours and hours of time. I just want it to pay what it owes us.

JC, by email

This is not the first letter we have had about Vueling not paying up in these circumstances, and I suspect it will not be the last.

Happily for you, I asked the company about your case and it has finally agreed to hand over the money.

It tells me: “We understand that this issue has caused real frustration for your reader, and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience and distress.

“We have investigated your reader’s case and found that, due to a processing issue, unfortunately the compensation payment was delayed. We have now resolved the issue and processed the payment, so the compensation has been issued to your reader.”

You told me that you found out the good news after returning from a difficult stay in hospital, and you let out a whoop of joy. I’m glad this saga had a happy ending."

UPDATE 4-Lufthansa gives subdued 2024 outlook as labour disputes weigh,"Lufthansa warned on Thursday its operating losses in the first quarter will widen and gave a subdued outlook for 2024 as the German airline struggles with costly labour disputes, offsetting the travel boom.

The airline said operating results this year would be on par with 2023, but Chief Financial Officer Remco Steenbergen said there was ""no hard commitment"" to meet a target for operating margins to hit 8% for the year. They were 7.6% in 2023.

Steenbergen said the company would try to get ""as close as possible"" to the 8% target, and would broadly keep the target even if Lufthansa doesn't achieve it this year.

Adjusted EBIT margins will fall to 6.9% this year from 7.6% in 2023, according to a company-provided analyst poll.

Europe's airlines have benefited from unprecedented demand after the pandemic, allowing them to raise prices, but higher labour and maintenance costs have limited earnings growth.

Lufthansa in particular has agreed to new, higher pay deals to end strikes, which analysts and investors say threaten its 2024 operating margin target.

On Thursday, Lufthansa ground staff walked off the job, while on Wednesday cabin crew voted to strike as they seek a 15% wage increase, a potential harbinger of further profit erosion.

The strikes are likely to contribute to a larger-than-expected operating loss in the first quarter of 2024, the company said, with the second and third quarters set to be strong.

Shares were down 1.4% at 0922 GMT.

Despite the flat operating result expected in 2024, the company said its results were strong enough to propose issuing a divided of 0.30 euros a share, to be voted on at the annual general meeting on May 7.

The group has not issued a dividend since 2019.

The results come almost two weeks after the airline announced the surprise departure of Steenbergen, which knocked its share price and rattled investor confidence.

Operating profits for 2023 were up 76% from 1.5 billion euros ($1.63 billion) in 2022. Revenues of 35.4 billion euros ($38.58 billion) were up almost 15%, but were lower than the 36.3 billion euros expected in a company-issued poll.

CAPACITY

Analysts pointed to Lufthansa's slower growth in capacity compared to its rivals, with the group struggling with some plane groundings tied to RTX's Pratt & Whitney engine issues.

""We continue to see a more cautious pace of capacity restoration at Lufthansa versus other European peers,"" Bernstein analyst Alex Irving said.

The carrier's shares have outperformed European rival flag carriers Air France-KLM and IAG since early 2022 as the region's travel industry recovered from disruption caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Last week, results from Air France and British Airways owner IAG put the spotlight on challenges for the industry from high prices of jet fuel, to geopolitical flashpoints, problems at plane makers and wage talks.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Lufthansa sees 2024 operating results on par with last year as costs rise,"Lufthansa reported on Thursday an operating profit of 2.7 billion euros for 2023 as expected and said 2024 operating results will be on par with last year as the German airline struggles with costly labour disputes.

The impact of strikes and a drop in logistics profits will lead to a higher expected operating loss in the first quarter than in earlier years, the German airline said, offsetting strong post-COVID travel demand.

""The group remains committed to its goal of generating a sustainable adjusted EBIT margin of at least 8 percent,"" the company said in a statement.

British Airways to offer free in-flight use of messaging apps,"British Airways is to offer free instant messaging on most flights and a new app to allow customers to automatically book alternative travel in cases of disruption, as part of a £7bn overhaul to spruce up the national carrier.

Passengers on planes with wifi – about 80% of the Heathrow fleet, plus all of the smaller Gatwick operation – will from next month be able to send texts on services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger free of charge during the flight.

Currently passengers have to pay a small fee to use basic wifi services, but all who sign up to the airline’s free loyalty club will be able to use text messaging services – although not make calls or send images – without charge.

The airline is also bringing in new seating and lounges for premium customers and spending £750m to modernise its creaky IT system.

The overhaul follows criticism from frequent flyers, after elements of BA’s service were pared back to compete with budget airlines, even before the cost-cutting and loss of staff in the pandemic. The airline’s chief executive, Sean Doyle, said it was “on a journey to a better BA”.

The airline said all its aircraft should have inflight wifi by the end of 2025. Although other “full-service” global carriers such as KLM and Lufthansa already offer free messaging, BA hopes it will be a point of difference from its biggest UK short-haul competitors, easyJet and Ryanair.

BA has unveiled new seats for its short-haul fleet, to be introduced when new Airbus planes arrive from May, fitted with better and more accessible charging ports. In its premium Club Europe seats it is bringing back a bespoke leather tray that straddles the vacant middle seat for extra comfort.

Much of the £7bn investment, announced alongside rebounding profits last week, will be in new, more fuel-efficient planes, but a significant sum will be spent on back-end IT and improvements to the public website and app.

One change, coming at the end of 2024, is to allow customers to make their own rebookings in times of disruption, should they wish, including for other airlines and emergency hotels. Passengers have often complained of long wait times to reach call centres during occasional mass disruption.

Doyle said the investment would also address resilience at Heathrow, using AI to predict delays and speed up operations, as well as hiring a further 350 people to work in customer service.

He said: “We’re going to take delivery of new aircraft, introduce new cabins, elevate our customer care, focus on operational performance and address our environmental impact by reducing our emissions and creating a culture of sustainability … we are laser-focused on transforming our business and fixing any pain points for our customers.”

The airline will also start direct flights in autumn to two popular Asian destinations, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, which were dropped from its network during the Covid pandemic."
British Airways is Back: Two Asian Capitals Rejoin Route Network,"British Airways (BA) is returning to two major Asian capital cities. Bangkok will rejoin the route map in October, with Kuala Lumpur beginning in November.

Both destinations were served by the UK flag carrier before the pandemic. However, their lingering absence from the post-Covid network left many wondering if they would return at all.

Kuala Lumpur is due to start on November 10 and will operate from the carrier’s primary home and hub at Heathrow Airport. As a clear statement of intent, BA will fly daily on the revived route, with its full spectrum of cabin options.

The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner rostered for the route is in a four-class configuration. There will be eight seats in First, 42 in Club (business class), 39 in World Traveller Plus (premium economy), and 127 in World Traveller (economy).

Commercial Shift for Bangkok
British Airways is taking a rather different commercial approach for its Bangkok service. Thailand is a hugely popular destination for visitors from Britain and surrounding markets, but it has historically been a leisure-heavy route. Price-sensitive backpackers and beach-lovers don’t usually make for a lucrative flight.

BA will be hoping that the soaring popularity of ‘premium leisure’ traffic will help boost the profitability of the revived Bangkok link. This was a key trend discussed just last week during parent company IAG’s annual results.

The developments come as Thailand seeks to overhaul its image. Last year, the country’s tourism authority launched a major new marketing campaign with a focus on more meaningful travel.

British Airways will fly thrice weekly from its secondary London base at Gatwick Airport to the Thai capital. This marks a notable change from its pre-pandemic daily service from Heathrow.

Flights will be operated by older three-class Boeing 777-200ERs during the coming winter season and start on October 28.

As British Airways’ domestic air connectivity at Gatwick is almost non-existent, the airline will be drawing many outbound passengers from the London airport’s enormous catchment area.

Competitive Pressures
Despite being a major global player, BA faces incredibly tough competition for travel from London to both destinations.

From Heathrow, Thai Airways and EVA Air operate nonstop to Bangkok, while Malaysia Airlines flies daily to Kuala Lumpur.

An additional threat comes from Middle Eastern carriers who channel tens of thousands of European passengers a day through hubs such as Dubai and Doha and onwards to Asia. Fares are often low, with regional departure and arrival points adding to the appeal.

Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur joins Abu Dhabi (UAE), Agadir (Morocco), and Izmir (Türkiye) as new or restarted destinations for British Airways this year."
British Airways to offer free in-flight access to messaging apps,"British Airways passengers will be able to use messaging apps on flights free of charge from next month.

The airline said it will roll out the service over two weeks from April 3, enabling travellers to send and receive text on apps such as WhatsApp, iMessage, Facebook Messenger and Teams.

All the carrier’s Gatwick aircraft and more than 80% of its Heathrow-based fleet have wifi, with the remainder expected to be fitted with the technology by the end of 2025.

Passengers must register with British Airways’ free loyalty scheme to use complimentary onboard messaging, which will be restricted to a single device per person.

Those wanting to use apps to send or receive images, videos or attachments, browse the internet or stream content can purchase passes costing between £4.99 and £21.99.

Enhanced wifi access is part of British Airways’ £7 billion “transformation plan”.

This includes developing a new mobile app and website, which will improve assistance given to customers whose flights are cancelled.

The airline said the changes will enable passengers to book seats on alternative flights, including those operated by other carriers.

Passengers entitled to hotel rooms and food will also be sent vouchers direct to their electronic devices.

Difficulties accessing call centres or finding staff at airports means customers of all airlines are often forced to pay up front for food and accommodation during disruption, and later submit claims for reimbursement.

This leads many passengers to miss out on what they should receive under consumer laws because they are unaware of their rights or cannot afford the costs.

Television presenter Steph McGovern hosted an event for the airline in the City of London on Monday night, at which she told bosses: “I’ll be honest with you, I hate the app.”

Chief commercial officer Colm Lacy replied: “I wish I had a pound every time I heard that statement.”

He added: “Having a new technology platform allows us to do things that we just can’t do on our existing platform. It’s all about personalisation.”

Other areas included in the “transformation plan” are new short-haul and first class seats, using AI to boost flight punctuality and aircraft reliability, a new lounge at Dubai Airport, and the return of flights between Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur, and between Gatwick and Bangkok.

British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle said: “We’re on a journey to a better BA for our people and for our customers, underpinned by a transformation programme that will see us invest £7 billion over the next two years to revolutionise our business.

“We’re going to take delivery of new aircraft, introduce new cabins, elevate our customer care, focus on operational performance and address our environmental impact by reducing our emissions and creating a culture of sustainability.

“We’re also heavily investing in the development of a new ba.com website and app and are laser-focused on transforming our business and fixing any pain points for our customers.”"
EU antitrust regulators halt for now probe into IAG's Air Europa deal,"EU antitrust regulators last month temporarily halted their investigation into British Airways owner IAG's 400-million-euro ($434.28 million) bid to buy out Air Europa, according to a European Commission update on its site on Monday.

The EU competition enforcer had been poised to hit IAG with an antitrust warning regarding the deal in a sign that it wanted the carrier to beef up its package of remedies submitted last month, sources had told Reuters.

""We can confirm that on 1 March 2024 the Commission stopped the clock in its investigation into the acquisition of Air Europa by IAG, with effect as of 9 February 2024,"" a Commission spokesperson said, adding the enforcer had requested certain data.

""Once the missing information is supplied by the parties, the clock is re-started and the legal deadline for the Commission’s decision is then adjusted accordingly.""

The Commission's previous deadline to decide on the deal was June 7.

IAG and Air Europa scrapped a previous deal in 2021 after their remedies failed to address EU competition concerns."

US inflation gauge hits lowest level in nearly three years,"US consumer prices increased at their slowest rate in nearly three years, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, keeping a June interest rate cut for America on the table.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by 2.4pc in January, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said, in the smallest year-on-year increase since February 2021.

It followed a 2.6pc advance in December.

Bond markets rallied after the news, with UK gilt yields having earlier hit a three-month highs amid worries over European inflation.

Yields, the return the Government promises to pay buyers of its debt, which moves inversely to prices, have fallen across the Continent after the US data.

RSM US chief economist Joseph Brusuelas said the PCE figures showed “sustained goods deflation” in America.

Private hospital giant boosts revenue amid NHS crisis
Revenue at private hospital chain Spire Healthcare jumped 13.4pc last year to £1.4bn as patients fled waiting lists at NHS hospitals.

The group, which started life as the hospitals division of Bupa insurance, experienced 9.5pc growth in its revenue from private patients, while the value of services delivered on behalf of the NHS rose 15.5pc.

Spire said that it had benefited from increasing numbers of patients choosing its hospitals through the NHS booking systems, and from helping local NHS trusts with their backlogs.

It said 58pc of its NHS-funded patients had orthopaedic problems, highly sought after by private hospitals because the treatments, including hip and knee replacements, usually have good margins.

Profits, however, remained wafer thin at £27.9m, despite rising 240pc.

Electronic Arts to cut 5pc of workforce
Video game maker Electronic Arts is to cut around 5pc of its workforce, or approximately 670 employees, as redundancies in the technology and gaming sector continue after a surge of hiring in recent years.

The company, which makes games such as Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, expects to incur up to $165m (£131m) in charges related to the move, which will also involve cutting office space.

It said that there has been a rapid shift in the type of games customers are playing towards “open world” ones giving players a lot of choices, which means it is now axing some of the titles it had under development

The announcement comes just days after Sony said that it would cut about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, or about 8pc of its global workforce.

Mr Barclay told industry executives last month that big sewage discharges could be punished with bans on dividends and bonuses.

However, according to Bloomberg, Gareth Davies, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, has written to water industry representatives saying: “The Government has no plans to block water company dividends over illegal pollution events.”

Ofwat will nonetheless receive new powers from next year to block dividends if they could put a company’s financial health at risk, Mr Davies said in the letter, seen by Bloomberg.

British Airways owner’s annual profits soar to £2.3bn on leisure boom,"The owner of British Airways has announced bumper profits for 2023 on the back of sustained demand for leisure flights, with operating profits doubling year on year and exceeding 2019’s pre-Covid haul.

IAG reported an annual profit of €2.7bn (£2.3bn) after tax, on operating profits of €3.5bn (£3bn), with high fares and premium leisure travel compensating for smaller numbers of business travellers.

The airline group said demand continued to be strong, despite the impact of a recession in the UK, although it did not expect a further significant rise in fares after large increases in 2023.

Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, said: “We don’t see any weakness in the market.”

He said the group had last year “more than doubled its operating margin and profits compared with 2022, generated excellent free cashflow and strengthened its balance sheet position, recovering capacity to close to pre-Covid-19 levels in most of its core markets”.

British Airways, which retired its Boeing 747 jumbos during the pandemic, was flying at only 90% of its previous capacity, partly because of the continued weakness or closure of some destinations in Asia, but would return to near 2019 levels this year, with more frequencies on transatlantic routes.

IAG’s chief financial officer, Nicholas Cadbury, said: “With a good fare increase over the last year, right now we are looking at growing our capacity by about 7%. We’re seeing fares being sustained at the moment … So it’s good news, but our priority is to make sure we just fill in that additional capacity.”

The British national carrier is also planning a £7bn overhaul over the next few years, including the purchase of new planes but also investing in updating its business-class seats, lounges and food. It is also revamping its IT systems after a series of high-profile problems in recent years.

Gallego said: “British Airways is our biggest asset with huge potential and that’s the reason we are investing.”

Meanwhile, IAG announced the appointment of new chief executives for British Airways’s Spanish sister airlines in the group, with the Vueling boss, Marco Sansavini, taking over at Iberia, replacing the interim chief, Fernando Candela, who moves to run Level, while a former British Airways director, Carolina Martinoli, takes over at Vueling."
British Airways owner soars on post-Covid travel boom,"The owner of British Airways has notched up record annual earnings after cashing in on the post-Covid bounce back in global travel demand.

International Airlines Group (IAG) reported underlying operating profits of €3.5 billion (£3bn) for 2023, nearly three times the €1.3bn it reported in 2022 and higher than its pre-pandemic peak.

The group – which also owns airlines Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus – said demand continues to be robust, particularly from leisure travellers, with the group’s airlines 92pc booked for the first quarter of the year and 62pc booked up for the first half.

Its results showed that pre-tax profits for the year jumped to €3.1bn from €415m in 2022.

However, shares fell 1pc amid concerns over aircraft availability and softer demand for routes to and from Asia.

The company announced a new order for six Boeing 787-10 aircraft to be delivered to British Airways in 2025 and 2026, and one new Airbus A350-900 aircraft for Iberia.

IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said: “In 2023, IAG more than doubled its operating margin and profits compared to 2022... recovering capacity to close to pre-Covid 19 levels in most of its core markets.”

Luis Gallego

In the fourth quarter, underlying earnings lifted 5pc to €502m.

The group said capacity for the final three months of 2023 was at 98.6pc of the levels seen before the pandemic struck in 2019, with full-year capacity at 95.7pc of those levels.

At BA, capacity recovered more slowly to 90.1pc of 2019 levels due to the slower rebound in Asia Pacific.

The group said it expects to grow overall capacity by around 7pc in 2024.

John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said: “IAG hasn’t really taken off since the Covid-19 pandemic, with the shares broadly where they were during the summer of 2020.

“But, easyJet’s return to the FTSE 100 confirms that conditions are generally smoother for airlines and today’s results from IAG may just be the catalyst its share price needs.

“Profits have surged and the group looks like it will generate significant amounts of free cashflow this year, underpinned by strong bookings for the first half of 2024.

“There are, however, still clouds on the horizon, with aircraft availability and softer demand for routes to and from Asia likely to be ongoing challenges.”"
British Airways owner soars to record annual earnings on travel boom,"The owner of British Airways has notched up record annual earnings after cashing in on the bounce back in global travel demand.

International Airlines Group (IAG) reported underlying operating profits of 3.5 billion euros (£3 billion) for 2023, nearly three times the 1.3 billion euros (£1.1 billion) in 2022 and higher than its pre-pandemic peak.

The group – which also owns airlines Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus – said demand continues to be robust, particularly from leisure travellers, with the group’s airlines 92% booked for the first quarter of the year and 62% booked up for the first half.

Its results showed that pre-tax profits for the year jumped to 3.1 billion euros (£2.7 billion) from 415 million euros (£355 million) in 2022 on revenues up 27.7% at 29.5 billion euros (£x billion).

In the fourth quarter, underlying earnings lifted 5% to 502 million euros.

Luis Gallego, IAG chief executive, said: “In 2023, IAG more than doubled its operating margin and profits compared to 2022… recovering capacity to close to pre-Covid 19 levels in most of its core markets.”

The group said capacity for the final three months of 2023 was at 98.6% of the levels seen before the pandemic struck in 2019, with full-year capacity at 95.7% of those levels.

At BA, capacity recovered more slowly to 90.1% of 2019 levels, largely due to the slower rebound in Asia Pacific.

The group said it expects to grow overall capacity by around 7% in 2024.

But shares in the group fell 2% in morning trading on Thursday.

Mr Gallego shrugged off the impact of a recession in the UK on demand, saying it “continues to be very strong, particularly in leisure”.

“We don’t see any weakness in the market,” he added.

He remained tight-lipped on the outlook for air fares this year, saying only that they would be “determined by the market”.

The group said corporate passenger demand in North America was impacted at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2024 by the Gaza conflict and concerns over instability in the Middle East.

But he said demand in the US market was showing signs of recovery in the second and third quarters.

He added that punctuality was improving at BA, with levels in January close to where they were before Covid.

It is investing heavily in its operations at Heathrow after service was hampered in recent years by disruption and air traffic control (ATC) problems.

The group is spending £7 billion overall on BA over the next three years – on areas such as IT and new aircrafts.

“British Airways is our biggest asset with huge potential and that’s the reason we are investing,” Mr Gallego said."
BA owner IAG positive for 2024 on sustained travel demand,"British Airways owner IAG said on Thursday it had more than doubled its operating profit last year and gave a positive outlook for 2024 on the back of sustained travel demand.

European airlines have so far reported strong summer forward bookings as they benefit from a continuing post-pandemic travel boom, but concerns over high jet fuel prices and geopolitical uncertainty have weighed on their outlooks.

""In 2023 IAG more than doubled its operating margin and profit compared to 2022, generated excellent free cash flow and strengthened its balance sheet position,"" IAG CEO Luis Gallego said in a statement.

Gallego said that the Middle East conflict had impacted mostly corporate demand in the last quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, but was expected to recover.

Unlike other airlines, IAG said it was not concerned over capacity for the year to come and was not expecting delays in Boeing deliveries this year.

Gallego said that if the certification of Boeing's 737 MAX 10 is slowed down, they can convert to other variants.

The U.S. planemaker is mired in a regulatory audit and has been prohibited from ramping up 737 MAX production since the Jan. 5 mid-air panel blowout of a new Alaska Airlines MAX 9, with airlines like Ryanair I> saying they expect delivery delays.

""For the time being we aren't worried. We are sure they'll fix the situation,"" Gallego told a press call.

IAG's full-year operating profit was 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion), up from 1.22 billion euros in 2022, while its debt, which has been a concern to investors and has weighed on its shares, fell to 9.2 billion euros from 10.4 billion euros.

The group, which also owns Iberia, said it would continue investing in BA in particular as part of its growth strategy and that it would aim to improve its website and customer service.

""IAG is also hoping to boost efficiency by reducing disruption. These are all great targets, but the pace of delivery is far from guaranteed. It's crucial that BA gets this right,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

IAG and Air France shares drop as airlines brace for turbulence,"Shares in British Airways owner IAG and Air France-KLM dropped on Thursday as concerns over costs, supplies of new jets, and geopolitical risks overshadowed strong 2023 results.

As consumers continue to prioritise travel in the wake of the pandemic, European airlines are reporting strong summer bookings. But high jet fuel prices, global flashpoints, problems at plane manufacturers, and wage talks are clouding prospects.

Case in point: despite record revenues for 2023 as a whole, Air France-KLM swung to an unexpected loss in the last quarter, hit by higher costs and disruptions caused by conflict in the Middle East, sending its shares down as much as 10.7%.

Analysts are also worried whether manufacturers will be able to keep up with strong demand for new planes amid ongoing supply chain problems, particularly as Boeing grapples with quality issues and a regulatory crackdown following the blowout of a panel on one of its MAX 9 jets during a flight on Jan. 5.

""The problem is not selling the tickets. We can sell every seat we want,"" said Air France-KLM finance chief Steven Zaat, adding the issue was having enough capacity.

Even IAG, which more than doubled its operating profit last year and gave a positive outlook for 2024, saw its shares turn negative to trade down 1% in the afternoon.

""Concerns over aircraft availability and demand in some of its key markets, alongside stickier than expected inflation in Europe, have overshadowed what were some generally positive results,"" said John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin.

""It may not be the market response the company anticipated, but IAG is on a much surer footing nonetheless.""

People familiar with the matter also told Reuters that European Union antitrust regulators were likely to warn IAG about its 400-million-euro ($434 million) bid to buy out Air Europa, suggesting that remedies offered by IAG last week were not sufficient to address their concerns.

'WE'RE BEING STIFLED'

With concerns over keeping up with demand shared across the industry, Emirates Airlines President Tim Clark expressed doubts on Thursday about the company getting its order of Boeing aircraft by the end of next year, in light of the U.S. regulatory scrutiny.

""We're all being stifled by not only supply chain, but the ability of the manufacturers to get those aircraft out the door,"" Clark told an industry lunch in London.

In another example of possible clouds on the horizon, analysts and investors told Reuters that Lufthansa will likely miss its 2024 profit margin goal as the German airline seeks to agree higher pay deals to end prolonged strikes.

IAG CEO Luis Gallego said the Middle East conflict had impacted mostly corporate demand in the last quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, but that was expected to recover.

Unlike other airlines, IAG, which also owns Iberia, said it was not concerned over capacity for the year to come and was not expecting delays in Boeing deliveries this year.

Gallego said that if the certification of Boeing's 737 MAX 10 was slowed down, IAG could convert to other variants.

""For the time being we aren't worried. We are sure they'll fix the situation,"" he told a press call.

Both IAG and Air France-KLM said bad weather had impacted costs too.

Air France-KLM reported a 2023 operating profit of 1.7 billion euros, in line with expectations.

However, its fourth-quarter operating loss of 56 million euros was far short of analysts' consensus forecast for a profit of 88 million euros, according to a company poll.

Still, Air France-KLM was able to pay down 1.3 billion euros in debt, much of which was amassed during the pandemic travel shutdown, leaving outstanding net debt at 5 billion euros.

""We can be satisfied of our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and restore the Group's equity,"" Chief Executive Ben Smith said.

The group said it expected costs would not go up as quickly as they did in 2023, and added that for the summer of 2024 its capacity would be close to 2019 levels.

Bernstein analysts said Air France-KLM's fourth quarter loss was impacted by one-off disruption costs and the implementation of an employee shareholding plan.

""Importantly, real-terms cost reduction looks set to continue, supporting margin expansion ahead,"" they added."
China property crisis deepens as Moody's withdraws credit ratings,"China’s property crisis deepened as Moody’s withdrew a flurry of credit ratings from key companies.

The credit ratings agency issued sudden removals for 11 Chinese businesses today in a blow to Beijing’s efforts to revive the fortunes of the world’s second largest economy.

Moody’s withdrew scores from 10 Chinese developers, including Logan Group, Ronshine China and Zhenro Properties Group, saying the decision was down to “business reasons”.

Earlier it had removed its Baa3 score - one step away from junk territory - from one of the country’s major bad-debt managers, China Great Wall Asset Management.

The sudden action comes after Moody’s cut its outlook for Chinese sovereign bonds to negative in December.

China has been grappling a post-pandemic economic downturn that has led to a significant slump in property investment across the country, which has led to a slowdown in growth.

One of the China’s biggest housebuilders, Evergrande, collapsed in 2021, which spooked the whole market. Other developers have also been going bust.

Fertility rate slumps to record low in ‘slow-burn’ economic crisis
The fertility rate in England and Wales has dropped to a record low, with British women having fewer children than at any point since at least 1939 in a “slow-burn” economic crisis. Eir Nolsøe reports:

New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the fertility rate, which measures the average number of children a woman of childbearing age will have, dropped to 1.49 in 2022.

The number, which is the lowest in 83 years, comes amid an increasingly political debate about why women are having fewer children.

Many politicians and economists fear that the economy will struggle to grow and living standards will stagnate or decline as the number of older people increases while fewer children are born.

Retailers launch last-ditch attempt to get Hunt to scrap tourist tax
Retailers have launched a last-ditch effort to persuade Jeremy Hunt to scrap Britain’s tourist tax in the Budget with the most detailed evidence yet that removing it will spark a £3.8bn tourism boom. Szu Ping Chan and Hannah Boland report:

The Association of International Retail (AIR) and New West End Company, which represents retail businesses in London’s key shopping areas, submitted fresh evidence to Downing Street this week contradicting Treasury assumptions that reinstating VAT-free shopping will cost £2.5bn in foregone tax revenues.

Its evidence, based on detailed spending data collected through its network of retailers, suggests that the amount of lost VAT will be just one fifth of the Treasury’s projection because EU visitors spend less money on shopping than on hotels, leisure and dining out.

The AIR notes that the Treasury’s original forecast was based on the assumption that tax-free shopping has little or no impact on how international travellers behave or where they decide to go on holiday.

Its analysis shows that the cost of foregone VAT is likely to be closer to £525m based on how visitors from inside and outside the EU spend their money.

Germany businesses downbeat, key survey shows
Germany’s businesses remain mired in pessimism, a key survey showed Friday, as Europe’s largest economy struggles with shortages of skilled labor, slower global trade, high interest rates and political squabbling.

The closely watched Ifo institute survey of business sentiment rose only slightly to 85.5 points in February from 85.2 points in January due to “slightly less pessimistic expectations,” the institute said in an accompanying statement.

“The German economy is stabilising at a low level,” the institute said.

The survey results follow a sharp downgrade of the government’s expectations for growth this year, to only 0.2pc, from 1.3pc in the previous forecast. Germany’s economy shrank 0.3pc in 2023, the worst performance by a major economy and a reversal of years of economic success as an export champion.

Giant chemical company BASF on Friday joined a string of major employers saying they would cut positions, citing a “low-demand environment.” The company said it made money last year “in all significant countries except Germany” and losses at its home base in Ludwigshafen meant it would seek to cut cut costs there by €1.1bn (£940m) a year by the end of 2026.

Other employers recently announcing job reductions include appliance maker Miele, which plans to move 700 jobs to Poland, and Deutsche Bank, which said it will drop 3,500 positions."
"IAG risks EU warning on Air Europa deal if no remedies soon, source says","British Airways owner IAG may get a warning from EU antitrust regulators on its 400-million-euro ($432.4 million) bid to buy out Air Europa if it does not offer remedies in the coming months, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.

The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into the deal last month, saying it may reduce competition on domestic routes to the Balearic and Canary islands, and on short-haul routes between Madrid and the main cities in Europe, Israel, Morocco, Britain and Switzerland.

The EU competition enforcer, which has also said long-haul routes between Madrid and North and South America may also see less competition, declined to comment on Thursday.

IAG, which also owns Iberia, could see a charge sheet known as a statement of objections setting out the Commission's concerns about the deal, in the coming weeks if no remedies are offered before then, the person said.

The Commission, which is set to decide on the deal by June 7, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

IAG's Chief Executive Luis Gallego has previously said he is ready to offer remedies to address the EU concerns, saying it was talking to companies which may potentially take up the remedies.

IAG wants to buy the 80% of Air Europa it did not already own from Spain's Globalia.

The carriers terminated a previous deal in 2021 after EU regulators indicated their remedies were insufficient to alleviate competition concerns."
International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) Has More To Do To Multiply In Value Going Forward,"There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.

Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on International Consolidated Airlines Group is:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.16 = €3.5b ÷ (€43b - €21b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).

So, International Consolidated Airlines Group has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Airlines industry average of 10% it's much better.

Check out our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group

In the above chart we have measured International Consolidated Airlines Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for International Consolidated Airlines Group .

What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us
The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 22% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 16%. 16% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that International Consolidated Airlines Group has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.

Another thing to note, International Consolidated Airlines Group has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 49%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.

The Key Takeaway
In the end, International Consolidated Airlines Group has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. However, despite the favorable fundamentals, the stock has fallen 60% over the last five years, so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. For that reason, savvy investors might want to look further into this company in case it's a prime investment.

Dover’s Port Health Authority threatens legal action over Brexit lorry checks,"Health authorities in Dover could bring legal action against the Government if it does not reconsider a plan to move checks on potentially dangerous foods away from the port creating what they say is a biosecurity risk.

Dover’s Port Health Authority is worried about the numbers of cars, vans and lorries carrying large quantities of meat into Britain which could be contaminated, risking illegal foods entering the market and the spread of diseases such as African swine fever and foot and mouth.

Since Brexit, the Government has gradually been bringing in a new border system for checks.

From April, it wants to move spot checks on products of animal origin away from Dover, which handles a third of the UK’s trade in goods, to a site 20 miles inland at Sevington.

But the Port Health Authority and a parliamentary committee say there is no mechanism to ensure that vehicles that are sent for checks will go to the site and there is a risk that vehicles could be unloaded before they arrive there.

The health authority stepped up its opposition to the plan on Friday saying it had engaged legal counsel with a view to possibly taking action.

Lucy Manzano, head of the Dover Port Health Authority, told Reuters: “We can’t see how these changes are in the best interest of GB biosecurity and can be delivered in a way that it doesn’t put us all, as consumers, at risk.”

A Government spokesman said: “We have strict border controls in place to protect our high biosecurity standards – and are confident that existing and new infrastructure will have the capacity and capability to maintain these standards.

“We recognise the strategic importance of the port of Dover and are continuing to work with the port authority on future support options.”

The Port Health Authority’s concerns about biosecurity are shared by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, whose chair has written to minister Steve Barclay about the issue.

Woodford investors forced to accept large losses in ‘appalling’ compensation scheme
Thousands of investors in Neil Woodford’s fund have been forced to accept an “appalling” compensation scheme after the High Court backed a £230m repayment plan, campaigners say. Michael Bow reports:

Administrators to the fund, Link Fund Solutions (LFS), secured legal backing for a scheme on Friday that will compensate investors who lost out in 2019.

However, campaigners argue that the deal is not good enough because they believe investors deserve more compensation.

Mr Woodford’s fund collapsed after he was hit by a wave of redemptions, forcing the company to block people from taking their money out.

LFS was blamed for mismanaging the liquidity of the funds.

It agreed with UK regulators to pay compensation to around 250,000 of Woodford’s investors but LFS denies any wrongdoing.

More than 90pc of Woodford’s investors voted for the deal when it was proposed last year.

Can Piers Morgan follow Tucker Carlson into online superstardom?
To say relations between Piers Morgan and the Royal Family are at a low ebb would be an understatement. James Warrington reports:

After the controversial broadcaster named the so-called “royal racists” on his TalkTV show, Buckingham Palace threatened legal action. Then, Morgan sparked outrage by suggesting he would “dismember and incinerate” Prince Harry over his split with the rest of the Firm.

In a return salvo, the Duke of Sussex on Friday claimed that the former Mirror editor “knew perfectly well what was going on” about phone hacking at the newspaper.

But if the Royals are gearing up for a fresh fight, it is Morgan who has chosen the arena. The broadcaster this week announced he was quitting his show on TalkTV and will forge his own path on YouTube."
ICAGY or ULCC: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,"Investors looking for stocks in the Transportation - Airline sector might want to consider either International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY) or Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.

International Consolidated Airlines Group SA and Frontier Group Holdings are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ICAGY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ULCC has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.

Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.

The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.

ICAGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.04, while ULCC has a forward P/E of 29.14. We also note that ICAGY has a PEG ratio of 0.09. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ULCC currently has a PEG ratio of 0.52.

Another notable valuation metric for ICAGY is its P/B ratio of 1.58. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ULCC has a P/B of 2.99.

Based on these metrics and many more, ICAGY holds a Value grade of B, while ULCC has a Value grade of D.

ICAGY sticks out from ULCC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ICAGY is the better option right now."
IAG to invest 6 billion euros in Spain over next five years,"British Airways and Iberia owner IAG plans to invest 6 billion euros ($6.53 billion) in Spain over the next five years, the office of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Friday after he met with IAG's Chief Executive Luis Gallego.

That is an increase from 5 billion euros invested in the past five years, the premier's office added in a statement, and is meant to ""advance in the transformation process of its Spanish airlines"".

IAG owns Spanish flag carrier Iberia and low-cost Vueling, which is the largest Spain-bred airline by fleet size and destinations. IAG last February also agreed to buy the remaining 80% of Air Europa it did not already own in a 400-million-euro deal that was expected to be finalised this year."
British Airways to double Mandarin-speaking cabin crew on China routes,"British Airways will double the number of Mandarin-speaking cabin crew on its China routes, its chief customer officer said on Thursday, as the airline seeks to expand in the world's second-largest aviation market.

The IAG-owned carrier expects to have 50 more Mandarin-speaking cabin crew aboard its flights to Beijing and Shanghai by July, Calum Laming told Reuters, which will take the total number to 100 and make China its second-largest overseas crew base after India.

""Coming back to the market is a major priority for the airline. We would not be out here doubling the crew base size otherwise,"" Laming said. ""Being able to double the number of cabin crew on board has a lot of benefits in terms of language, in terms of cultural awareness.""

The British flag carrier resumed direct passenger flights to Shanghai in April and to Beijing in June last year, after China reopened borders shut by almost three years of COVID-19 curbs.

It faces stiff competition, however, from Chinese state-owned carriers on fares, and has to fly a longer route bypassing Russian airspace due to a ban related to the war on Ukraine.

British Airways was the second-largest operator of flights to and from China in December 2019, flying 133 times a month before the pandemic, according to aviation data provider Cirium.

But the airline is currently offering just 89 flights a month, December 2023 data shows, putting it in fourth position behind China's three largest carriers: Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines.

Laming said an industry-wide aircraft shortage was the biggest barrier to increasing China flights. ""Getting new aircraft is very, very difficult at the moment,"" he added.

THIRD TIME LUCKY?

The British carrier's plan to increase the number of Mandarin-speaking cabin crew on its China routes comes after passengers accused three crew-members of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific of being biased against non-English speakers. The three were later fired.

On Monday, Cathay announced it had taken on 100 new Mandarin-speaking cabin crew on Greater China routes.

This is British Airway's third crack at building up its brand in China in just over a decade.

The airline added flight to Chengdu in 2013, but scrapped the route three years later, citing lack of commercial viability. In 2019, British Airways was the first international airline to announce that it would fly from Beijing's new Daxing Airport, but then the pandemic upended the industry.

""We are really seeing recovery,"" Laming said. ""We had hugely strong leisure demand last summer and we're hoping for a fantastic Chinese New Year peak travel season."""
IAG to offer remedies to EU for Air Europa deal,"British Airways owner IAG expects EU antitrust regulators to open a full-scale investigation into its plan to buy Spain's Air Europa and will offer remedies to address their concerns, IAG's chief executive said on Tuesday.

The deal is part of a wave of consolidation in the airline sector, with Germany's Lufthansa seeking to buy a minority stake in Italy's state-owned ITA Airways, and Korean Air looking to buy Asiana.

EU regulators have recently taken a tougher line when deciding whether to approve deals, and now sometimes want acquiring airlines to divest assets and not just give up some routes or airport slots to address competition concerns.

""We have informed the (European Commission) case team that we will formally present remedies in Phase 2 to allow them to fully assess the viability and relevance of our proposals,"" IAG's Luis Gallego said.

Phase 2 refers to the full-scale investigation that the Commission is set to launch at the end of its preliminary review on Jan. 24.

""In the meantime, we continue to test interest from a range of remedy takers to ensure they meet the Commission's requirements,"" Gallego said.

IAG, which also owns Iberia, in February last year said it had agreed to pay 400 million euros ($436 million) to Spain's Globalia for the 80% of Air Europa it did not already own."
The OnlyFans millionaire backing an attempt to take on British Airways,"A co-founder of OnlyFans is backing an airline startup that wants to rival British Airways.

Tom Stokely, a member of the Essex family that launched the adult subscription site, has emerged on the board of Global Airlines – a new carrier hoping to offer flights from London Gatwick to New York and Los Angeles.

Stokely, his brother Tim and father, Guy, set up OnlyFans in 2016. The subscription website, which is known for hosting adult content, saw explosive growth during the pandemic.

The Stokelys sold off a majority stake to US-based porn baron Leonid Radvinsky in 2019 for an undisclosed price. OnlyFans made a profit of £36m on subscription revenues of £1.7bn in the year of the sale.

During his time at OnlyFans, Tom Stokely served as the platform’s chief operating officer. The money he made from the site has since allowed Stokely to acquire shares in Global Airlines.

The business was founded three years ago by James Asquith, a former banker who broke the Guinness World record as the youngest person to fly to all 196 sovereign nations.

Stokely is also a former banker and first crossed paths with Asquith last year when he joined the advisory board of his travel business, Holiday Swap.

James Asquith founded Global Airlines after flying to all 196 sovereign nations
At the time of his appointment, Holiday Swap – an app that lets homeowners around the world rent each others’ properties –  hailed Stokely as a “skilful businessman” who had previously worked at a “major company” as chief operating officer. OnlyFans was not mentioned.

Unlike his brother, Tim, who has flaunted his wealth on social media, Tom has largely kept a low profile.

His role at Global Airlines has emerged as the start-up prepares to mount what many see as an audacious attempt to rival established carriers. Flights from London to New York would put the carrier in direct competition with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which dominate the route.

In interviews, Asquith has vowed to bring back the “golden age” of travel, frequently recalling memories of seeing his father, a pilot, donning his captain’s uniform before jetting off.

He has vowed to reinstate the glamour of travel through Global Airlines, promising to “revolutionise commercial flying” and make passengers “feel like a million dollars”.

Details of how he will do this remain thin but Global Airlines has said it will serve passengers Laurent-Perrier champagne on board and provide first-class customers with a chauffeur service straight to the airport.

“For the past 20 years, everybody has done the same thing, which is have this race to the bottom on price,” he told The Times last year.

“Perks get taken away. You see the US carriers now and their loyalty programmes just get stripped. Year after year it gets worse and worse. Because everyone is drinking the same Kool-Aid.”

Some observers have said Asquith’s plans will breathe life into the transatlantic route. However, others question whether Global Airlines will ever fly passengers at all, given the costs and high regulatory hurdles associated with launching.

OnlyFans co-founder Tom Stokely
OnlyFans co-founder Tom Stokely joined the advisory board of Asquith’s travel business
John Strickland, an aviation consultant, says: “There are two sides to it. There’s an enormous list of challenges and the majority of startups never make it. But having met him, I think if anybody has a chance to do it then he’s got that chance.

“He’s conscious of the challenge but strikes me as someone who is very determined and in the process of getting people around him who have the right expertise.”

Dubai-based Asquith has so far built a fleet of four Airbus A380s, which he claimed to have acquired from German investment firm Doric last year.

Global Airlines hoped to have at least one of these super jumbo jets in operation by spring 2024, flying passengers across the Atlantic just three years after the company’s launch.

However, the start-up has since pushed back this goal and is now considering using its planes as a charter service for major events, such as the upcoming 2026 World Cup in the US.

A spokesman said: “Our intention is to commence with charter flights later in 2024 with scheduled services from the UK following that.

“We expect to operate our first round of passenger services in the next 12 months. However, we, like many other companies in aviation, have encountered some delays with our partners and multiple supply chain issues which we continue to work around and find solutions to.”

As for Stokely’s involvement in the project, which now involves around 100 people, there are more questions than answers as to what he will be responsible for.

Regardless, Stokely and Asquith face a mammoth task to get Global Airlines off the ground.

“To my mind, it’s still the devil’s own job to get there,” Strickland says, before adding: “I look back at my career and I thought Emirates and easyJet weren’t going to work. What do I know?”"
"Sabre (SABR), IAG Expand Relationship With New Distribution Deal","Sabre Corporation SABR, a global travel industry technology provider, has entered a multi-year distribution agreement with International Airlines Group (“IAG”). This collaboration aims to bolster their existing partnership and advance modern travel retailing practices.

Under the agreement, Sabre-connected travel buyers and agencies will gain the capability to sell traditional EDIFACT content and access competitive NDC (New Distribution Capability) offers from IAG's airlines, including British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling. The expanded content encompasses Additional Price Points and ancillaries, offering travel agencies a broader spectrum of options for comparison and selection.

This move aligns with the evolving landscape of modern travel retailing, emphasizing the differentiation of airline offerings and enhancing personalized experiences for travelers. Sabre and IAG are jointly committed to advancing the NDC standard, a pivotal element in the industry's progression toward modern airline retailing through offers and orders.

The partnership exemplifies IAG's digital retailing strategy, providing customers with increased access to NDC content. Sabre's involvement underscores its dedication to creating value and supporting the diverse interests of the global travel ecosystem.

Roshan Mendis, the chief commercial officer at Sabre Travel Solutions, noted that the travel industry is poised for a new era of personalized retailing, promising improved traveler experiences and new revenue opportunities for airlines and travel agencies. The collaboration with IAG signifies a shared commitment to driving the industry forward.

Sabre Continues Grabbing New Distribution Deals
IAG has become the latest addition to a group of 17 airlines collaborating with Sabre to offer their NDC content in the market. This list of airlines includes Aeromexico, Scandinavian Airlines, Finnair, United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL. All these companies have partnered or renewed the partnership with Sabre over the trailing 12 months.

In March 2023, the company announced that Sabre-connected travel buyers, agencies and developer partners will be able to access American Airlines’ NDC content through Sabre Red 360, Sabre APIs and GetThere. The new partnership allowed travel buyers on Sabre’s GDS to access AAL’s offers, including Main Select and Flagship Business Plus fares.

In April 2023, United Airlines introduced its NDC offers on Sabre’s GDS. This enabled travel buyers to access enhanced options, including UAL's continuous pricing content, featuring the most competitive fares available through Sabre Red 360, Sabre APIs and GetThere.

Sabre’s last few quarters’ financial results reflect that the company is moving toward stabilization after the severe impacts of the pandemic-led global economic crisis. The company recorded revenues of $748 million for the third quarter of 2023, which is significantly higher than the revenues of $663.4 million posted in the year-ago quarter.

This year-over-year surge in the top line reflects a significant improvement in global air, hotel and other travel bookings. Additionally, the company's Travel Solutions division benefited from favorable rates as international and corporate bookings continued to improve.

Zacks Rank and a Stock to Consider
American Airlines and United Airlines each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, while Sabre has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of UAL, AAL and SABR have plunged 7.2%, 6.4% and 32.1%, respectively, over the past year.

A better-ranked stock from the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised by a penny northward to $4.49 per share in the past seven days. For fiscal 2024, earnings estimates have increased by 2 cents to $12.31 in the past seven days.

NVIDIA's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19%. Shares of NVDA have surged 240.6% over the past year."
Airline accused of ‘cheating’ customers out of compensation on overbooked flights,"An airline has been accused of using a loophole to “cheat” customers out of compensation on overbooked flights.

Passengers flying with Spanish carrier Vueling are being contacted in advance if their flight has been overbooked, and offered travel vouchers to change their flight.

But travel experts warned that flyers who accept the offer could be missing out on the full compensation owed, including cash payouts and hotels.

Callum Tennant, who was due to fly from Gatwick to Bilbao on January 6, received an email days before he was due to travel, offering a discount of €225 (£194) on future bookings if he moved his flight to the next morning.

The email from the airline read: “In order to save you having to make last-minute plans, we are offering you the choice of another flight and, in exchange, you will get a discount of €225 per person which you will be able to use for future bookings. Would you be interested?”

Mr Tennant said: “I wasn’t convinced about changing my flight, because it would mean having to get to Gatwick from London at 5.30am. However, €225 seemed too much to refuse.”

He accepted the airline’s offer, but when the discount code for his flight credit arrived, the terms and conditions stated that the credit must be used on a single booking.

The terms said: “This discount code can only be used once and any remaining balance cannot be reused or refunded.”

The budget airline, which launched 20 years ago and has grown to be one of Spain’s biggest, launched its “voluntary rebooking” policy last year.

Vueling, which owns 124 aircraft, flies to 148 locations and operates more than 530 flights a week.

There are not many bookings available on the Vueling website that cost the full €225 voucher, meaning he felt that it was likely that he would not be able to make full use of the credit.

He said: “I feel cheated because I was taking them up on their deal in good faith. But they were completely misleading when they said future bookings.”


If Mr Tennant had been unable to board the flight because it was too full, he would have received more compensation than he was offered by Vueling.

Flyers who are “bumped” or denied boarding to their flight because it is overbooked, are due compensation under UK regulations, as long as they checked in on time.

Depending on how much later their replacement flight arrives, they can be due up to £220 for short-haul flights, and up to £520 for those of more than 3,500km.

But if travellers decide to voluntarily give up their seats, then it is up to them to negotiate with their airline the benefits that they receive in return.

Which? travel expert Jo Rhodes said flyers should think carefully about the benefits being offered by airlines before accepting.

“While the benefits offered by an airline may at first seem enticing, you should think carefully about how these measure up against your rights if the decision were taken out of your hands.”

She said: “If you were denied boarding at the gate you’d be entitled to the same care and compensation as if your flight had been cancelled.

“A flight voucher for a lesser amount seems rather stingy in comparison – particularly if it can only be used once and all remaining credit is lost.”

In 2019 Vueling was named the “most delayed” airline, with departures delayed by an average of 31 minutes, following French strikes. It improved to 10th place last year according to the latest Which? report, with an average delay of 22 minutes.

A Vueling spokesman confirmed that their “volunteering rebooking system” is activated when needed to “minimise any potential disruption to our clients”.

The spokesman continued: “The clients that accept this offer can use the discount code in the flight of their choice up until December 2024 as it is indicated in the terms and conditions. Our passengers have the right to not accept this offer and keep their original booking.”"
Ground service workers at Spain's Iberia postpone strike after New Year period,"Unions for ground service workers at International Airlines Group-owned Iberia have postponed a strike at Spanish airports that was announced for the New Year period.

The country's two main unions, the UGT and CCOO, delayed the two walkouts planned from Dec. 29 to Jan. 1 and Jan. 4-7 after the Spanish government agreed to act as mediator in the conflict with the airlines operator, CCOO said in a statement released late Wednesday.

They did not set a new date for the strikes.

Iberia's ground service workers, such as baggage handlers, at Spanish commercial airports, which are operated by state-controlled Aena, are protesting against contracts signed with new providers in September.

Aena hired new contractors for services which were previously provided by Iberia at many airports, angering unions even though the new suppliers committed to retaining workers and their working conditions.

The airline had said the strike, which would affect other carriers too, was irresponsible and made no sense."
British Airways apologises for ‘upset and hurt’ over Jewish sitcom decision,"British Airways has apologised for causing “upset and hurt” after pausing plans to show a Jewish sitcom on its flights.

The airline had intended to add comedy series Hapless, which has appeared on Netflix and Amazon Prime, to its inflight entertainment earlier this month but delayed plans over fears of appearing to take sides in the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

However, British Airways today changed course again and on Monday said that the series will appear on its flights early next year.

A spokesman said: “We understand that the decision to review the content has caused upset and hurt to the Jewish community, and we’re sorry – that was never our intention.

“We’re proud to offer a wide range of entertainment options for our customers to enjoy and constantly review these, taking into consideration current events. The series will appear on our aircraft early next year.”

It comes after Gary Sinyor, the writer and director of Hapless, on Friday criticised the airline for being “overcautious” considering the series is unrelated to the ongoing conflict.

Mr Sinyor last week told The Telegraph: “I think what it shows is a fear of being perceived as being pro Israel just because it’s got Jewish characters in it.”

British Airways in August struck a deal to buy the first season of Hapless, which follows the misadventures of a London-based cynical journalist for a fictional Jewish newspaper.

The airline planned to make the British comedy available for passengers to watch for six months from December, but scrapped this initial start date shortly after Hamas’ terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7.

British Airways is understood to have asked Spafax Media, an international media specialist hired by airlines to secure licensing rights to movies and television shows for in-flight entertainment, to review content onboard and being booked.

Mr Sinyor, who is Jewish, claimed he was told that British Airways did not want to “take sides” in the conflict by screening the six-episode season.

An email sent from Spafax to Mr Sinyor on Oct 13, seen by The Telegraph, said: “Their preference is to remain as neutral in these situations as possible.

“As a result we’ve been asked to remove Hapless from the December line-up but are very happy to book this once the conflict dies down.”

Spafax, which is owned by British advertising giant WPP, earlier this month told the filmmaker that British Airways was “still reluctant to get back to normal programming”.

British Airways is understood to have since completed this review process. The airline updates its on-board entertainment with new content every three months."
Jewish sitcom ‘paused’ from airline’s inflight entertainment,"British Airways has paused plans to stream a Jewish sitcom on its flights owing to alleged concerns it could trigger a backlash in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.

The airline delayed plans to add the comedy series Hapless, which has been shown on Netflix and Amazon Prime, to its in-flight entertainment system to avoid any appearance of taking sides in the ongoing conflict.

The satire follows misadventures of a London-based cynical journalist for a fictional Jewish newspaper and has been called the British version of  the US sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm.

British Airways in August agreed to buy the first season with plans to make it available for passengers to watch for six months from December.

However, the airline paused the £20,000 deal just days after the Hamas terrorist attack against Israel on Oct 7.

Gary Sinyor, the writer and director, was informed of the decision by Spafax Media, an international media specialist hired by airlines to secure licensing rights to movies and television shows for in-flight entertainment.

The award-winning director, who is Jewish, claimed he was told that British Airways did not want to “take sides” in the conflict by screening the six-episode season and wanted to delay the deal until after the war was over.

An email sent from Spafax to Mr Sinyor on Oct 13, seen by The Telegraph, said: “BA Press office have asked us to review content on board and being booked in relation to Israel/Palestine and the conflict currently happening. Their preference is to remain as neutral in these situations as possible.

“As a result we’ve been asked to remove Hapless from the December line-up but are very happy to book this once the conflict dies down.”

The filmmaker has since repeatedly challenged this decision, describing it as “nonsensical”.

Mr Sinyor told The Telegraph: “The series has nothing to do with Israel-Palestine. I mean, other than that the Jewish people live in Israel and that Israel is a Jewish state, it has nothing to do with it.

“I think what it shows is a fear of being perceived as being pro Israel just because it’s got Jewish characters in it.”

Spafax, which is owned by British advertising giant WPP, last week told Mr Sinyor that British Airways is “still reluctant to get back to normal programming”.

A British Airways spokesman on Friday said: “We are proud to offer a wide range of entertainment options for our customers to enjoy. We are constantly reviewing our content and are in the process of planning our 2024 schedule.”

Mr Sinyor said that delaying the screening in the first place was a “shocking” decision.

“It’s overcautious and if that’s reflected in British society then I think the Jewish community here would be concerned,” he said.

“I think that the Muslim community would be concerned as well if they found that things that had Muslim humour in them, or Muslim content or were being made by Muslim filmmakers were being vetoed in this way, even if it’s a temporary veto.”"
"Spain airport ground service workers plan New Year strike, Iberia says","Labour unions representing ground service workers at Spanish airports plan to strike from late December into early January, Spain's Iberia, part of the International Airlines Group, said.

The country's two main unions UGT and CCOO have called on workers to walk out between Dec. 29 and Jan. 7, Iberia said in a statement on Wednesday evening, adding the call is ""irresponsible"" and ""makes no sense"".

""A strike, like the one called by unions for Christmas hurts irremediably the right to holiday and reunite with families and friends,"" Iberia said.

Workers of ground services, such as baggage handling, at Spanish commercial airports, all of which are operated by state-controlled Aena, are protesting against new contracts recently signed.

They threatened to walk out on Dec. 5 and Dec. 10 though eventually called those strikes off. The two unions did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Aena hired new contractors for the services, which were previously provided by Iberia in many airports, angering unions, even as the new contractors have committed to retain workers and their working conditions.

Iberia is challenging the new contracts in courts. (Reporting by Inti Landauro and Jakub Olesiuk)"
IAG says it has sought EU antitrust approval for Air Europa deal,"Airline group IAG said on Monday that it had sought antitrust approval from the European Union for its previously announced plans to buy out the whole of Spanish low-cost airline Air Europa.

IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia, said it was ready to offer an ambitious and broad set of remedies to address the European Commission's concerns over the deal, and it was committed to closing the transaction as quickly as possible in 2024.

""We have notified our proposed acquisition of Air Europa to the European Commission today. The deal will deliver benefits for consumers and the wider Spanish economy, as well as improve Madrid's competitiveness with other European hubs,"" IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego said in a statement.

In February, IAG said it had agreed to pay 400 million euros ($429.80 million) to Spain's Globalia for the remaining 80% of Air Europa which it did not already own.

IAG will likely sound out various rivals, both EU and non-EU ones, to see if they are interested in taking its remedies. Airline mergers usually involve giving up airport slots to address competition concerns as well as offering access to loyalty programmes."
Latest deliveries leave Airbus within reach of target,"Airbus delivered 64 aircraft in November, down 6% from the same month of 2022, to bring the total so far this year to 623 units, the planemaker confirmed on Tuesday.

The tally leaves Airbus needing what several analysts say is a relatively achievable 97 deliveries in December to reach its full-year target of 720 deliveries.

That compares with an average of 93 December deliveries for the past three years or a December average of 131 units in the three years before the pandemic, when supply chains were running more smoothly.

Airbus brought its monthly operational bulletin forward by a day after Reuters earlier reported the delivery numbers.

Analysts have said Airbus' full-year delivery target is looking increasingly manageable after it missed and eventually abandoned such a goal amid supply problems last year, though CEO Guillaume Faury last week said supply chains remain challenging.

Airbus said it had won 1,512 orders so far this year or a net total of 1,395 after cancellations.

November's net orders included previously announced new business at the Dubai Airshow and from SMBC Aviation Capital, and reflected an A230neo cancellation from Kuwaiti lessor Alafaco, announced to the Kuwait stock exchange last month.

November's data also included the reshuffling of a handful of plane orders between airline group IAG and two of its subsidiaries, British Airways and Aer Lingus. (Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Chizu Nomiyama)"
Virgin Atlantic and BA face formal complaints over sustainability claims,"Virgin Atlantic and British Airways are facing formal complaints over their sustainable flight claims after being accused of misleading potential customers about the environmental credentials of aviation.

This week, a Virgin Atlantic plane took off on the first transatlantic flight by a commercial airliner fully powered by “sustainable” jet fuel, largely comprising cooking oil. The flight, partly funded by the UK government, flew to great fanfare from airlines and ministers as a potentially guilt-free way to fly. However, scientists and environmental groups are more sceptical.

The climate charity Possible and the law firm Leigh Day have filed formal complaints against the two major airlines over their claims about reducing emissions from flights.

The senior campaigner at Possible, Alethea Warrington, said: “The reality is that technologies for cleaner flight either don’t work, or don’t even exist yet. We think that airlines’ misleading claims about their emissions are unfair on people who want to do the right thing when they travel. It’s time for airlines to start being honest about their sky-high emissions.”

Related: Can UK’s ‘jet zero’ hopes take off with a plane fuelled by used cooking oil?

The complaints, filed under the National Contact point mechanism run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), set out that both airlines are misleading consumers over their claims on reducing carbon emissions from flights as the layperson does not have the expertise to discern the limits of decarbonisation technology.

Airlines claim they can use biofuels made from crops or green hydrogen made from renewable energy, but recent research from the Royal Society has found the UK would have to devote half its farmland or more than double its total renewable electricity supply to make enough aviation fuel to meet its ambitions for net zero flying.

The filing highlights that BA claims to be “driving urgent action towards net-zero emissions” and that it says it has a “clear roadmap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050”. However, analysis has found BA’s emissions from jet fuel have increased year-on-year between 2016 and 2019.

Virgin Atlantic features its “mission to net zero” on its promotional materials but fails to mention it is falling short of its emissions targets, which Possible has argued is crucial information for consumers.

The charity also points out scientific literature comparing the lifecycle emissions from biofuels with conventional jet fuel, “which is clear that these fuels may produce even more emissions and be worse for the climate than kerosene”. Both feedstocks produce fuels with similar tailpipe emissions to kerosene, and the emissions reductions are claimed to be created at a systemic level.

“For fuels derived from biomass, land is not available to produce crops for biofuels in sufficient quantities to power aviation without causing hugely damaging deforestation, which increase emissions and makes biofuels just as bad for the climate as kerosene, if not worse,” the charity said.

A British Airways spokesperson said: “In 2019, we committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 and, while there is no single solution to this challenge, as part of our BA Better World programme, we have a clear roadmap of initiatives to get there.

“In the short-term, this means improving our operational efficiency, investing in new, more fuel-efficient aircraft and progressively introducing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) with partnerships in the UK and US, while for the medium to longer term, we’re continuing to invest in the development of SAF – a critical path to decarbonise, and looking at how we can help with the growth of zero-emissions hydrogen-powered aircraft and carbon-removal technology.

“We were the first airline to report our carbon footprint more than two decades ago and were the first airline to voluntarily participate in the UK emissions trading scheme.”

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: “At Virgin Atlantic, we are committed to achieving net zero 2050 and have set interim targets on our pathway to get there, including 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

“There are two levers for delivering in-sector carbon reductions in the short to medium term: the fleet we operate and fuel we burn. We already fly one of the youngest and most efficient fleets across the Atlantic. Beyond fleet renewals, SAF presents an immediate opportunity to deliver lifecycle carbon reductions of up to 70% and is something we have been pioneering for over 15 years.”"

First time a commercial airliner has flown long-haul with SAF

(Adds CEO comments in paragraph 15)

By Sarah Young and Joanna Plucinska

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - A Virgin Atlantic passenger jet powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) completed a London-to-New York jaunt on Tuesday, showcasing the potential of low-carbon options, which are a tiny fraction of the industry's fuel mix.

The flight is not the first time the industry has staged demonstrations to highlight its aspiration to reduce emissions - and appeal for government support. Indeed, Tuesday's flight carried only Virgin's billionaire founder, Richard Branson, and a few others, and it is set to return to London using conventional jet fuel.

Airlines are banking on fuel made from waste to reduce their emissions by up to 70%, but the high cost and tight supply of materials needed to make SAF make large-scale production difficult. SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of total global jet fuel in use today and costs three to five times as much as regular jet fuel.

The flight, operated by a Virgin Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, is the first time a commercial airliner has flown long haul on 100% SAF. It had no paying passengers or cargo.

""It's going to take a while before we can get enough fuel where everybody's going to be able to fly. But you've got to start somewhere,"" said Branson in London before the plane took off.

Aviation is not an easy industry to decarbonize compared to road travel, and it accounts for an estimated 2-3% of global carbon emissions.

Engines in commercial use are not yet certified to fly on more than 50% SAF and the vast majority of flights blend in a much lower amount of SAF with traditional jet fuel.

SAF is already used in jet engines as part of a blend with traditional kerosene, but after successful ground tests, Virgin and its partners Rolls-Royce, Boeing, BP and others won permission to fly using only SAF from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Canadian and UK regulators.

The flight took off at 1149 GMT from London's Heathrow Airport with Branson, Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Shai Weiss and Britain's transport minister, Mark Harper, on board. It landed at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 1405 EST (1905 GMT), 35 minutes early, where it was met by U.S. Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg, among others.

Harper told Reuters after landing in New York that the flight was uneventful.

""If you hadn't known it was a 100% SAF flight, no one would have noticed,"" he said, calling the flight a key milestone toward 100% SAF adoption. Data from the flight ""will be as close to running a regular flight as you can get.""

He and Trottenberg plan to meet Wednesday with the investor community in New York ""about what they look for when they invest in SAF production - are there any barriers, are there any market failures, are there things governments need to do to help get this stuff over the line.""

The fuel used to power Tuesday's flight is mostly made from used cooking oil and waste animal fat mixed with a small amount of synthetic aromatic kerosene made from waste corn, Virgin Atlantic said.

The industry hopes that the Virgin flight will highlight to governments the need for them to provide financial support to make SAF more readily available.

The key to decarbonizing long haul aviation is through SAF, and for that, everyone needs to share the burden, Weiss said. He added that going forward, prices for sustainable aviation fuel will increase and they'll ""have to share it with consumers, with businesses, with the oil majors"".

Environmental advocacy group Stay Grounded called the flight ""a greenwashing distraction.""

""What is urgently needed is to reduce the burning of fossil jet fuels, which means reducing flights wherever possible,"" said Magdalena Heuwieser, who represents the network.

INDUSTRY CHALLENGES

A UK military version of the Airbus A330 airliner flew on the fuel last December, fuel supplier Air bp said. Dubai's Emirates said last week it had flown an A380, the world's largest airliner, using SAF for one of four engines.

Last week, a Gulfstream G600 business jet using the same fuel successfully crossed the Atlantic.

Many European airlines - including Virgin, IAG -owned British Airways, and Air France - have said they want to be using 10% SAF by 2030. The industry's goal of ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 relies on that share rising to 65%.

Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said SAF was the only solution to decarbonise commercial flights in the medium term, but analysts say the 2030 target looks challenging given SAF's small volumes and its high cost.

In October, the head of IAG warned that there was more than a 90% risk the industry would not meet the European Union mandate for SAF availability in 2025. Others have said governments have not provided enough industry support.

Virgin said the engines on the flight would be drained of SAF and tested before it returns to service using regular fuel.

International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A.'s (LON:IAG) stock price dropped 3.3% last week; retail investors would not be happy,"Key Insights
The considerable ownership by retail investors in International Consolidated Airlines Group indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy

47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders

Institutions own 20% of International Consolidated Airlines Group

Every investor in International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (LON:IAG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 55% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

And last week, retail investors endured the biggest losses as the stock fell by 3.3%.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Consolidated Airlines Group, beginning with the chart below.

Check out our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Consolidated Airlines Group?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

International Consolidated Airlines Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Consolidated Airlines Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

earnings-and-revenue-growth

International Consolidated Airlines Group is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Qatar Airways Limited is the largest shareholder with 25% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 13% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 1.5% by the third-largest shareholder.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of International Consolidated Airlines Group
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our information suggests that International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. insiders own under 1% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own UK£3.4m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership
The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 55% of International Consolidated Airlines Group shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.

Private Company Ownership
It seems that Private Companies own 25%, of the International Consolidated Airlines Group stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.

Next Steps:
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with International Consolidated Airlines Group (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

"Eurozone property debts worse than pre-financial crisis, warn ECB","Commercial property companies in the eurozone have worse debts than they had before the global financial crisis in 2008, the European Central Bank (ECB) has said, as it warned the sector could struggle for years under the weight of high interest rates.

A commercial real estate boom is now unravelling in countries like Germany and Sweden, the ECB outlined in a report that examines the impact of the currency bloc’s record high interest rates, which stand at 4pc.

It said eurozone banks have around 10pc of loans exposed to the commercial property sector, which is grappling with declining profitability as it faces “a higher likelihood of facing debt servicing challenges” compared to the residential market, which is supported by a strong employment.

The ECB said that commercial property prices have been hit by economic weakness and high interest rates over the last year, challenging the sector’s profitability and business model.

The report added that commercial property could “play a significant amplifying role in the event of broader market stress” as larger firms grapple with debt levels “close to or above pre-global financial crisis levels”.

It comes as deep cracks emerged in the property market of the eurozone’s largest economy, Germany, where the construction of one of the country’s tallest buildings has suddenly halted midway after the developer stopped paying its builder.

Signa Group, the Austrian property giant and owner of New York’s Chrysler Building, had been making steady progress this year on the planned 64-story Elbtower skyscraper in Hamburg but the company, founded by René Benko, fell behind on payments.

Wind turbine maker Siemens Energy plans €400m of cost cuts after €15bn bailout
Siemens Energy’s wind turbine division announced on Tuesday that it is to cut €400m (£350m) in costs after receiving a €15bn rescue package from the German government and a group of banks.

The troubled turbine division became wholly owned by Siemens Energy last year, but has been beset by quality control problems that potentially affect 2,900 onshore turbines out of 65,000 installed by the company.

The unit’s chief executive, Jochen Eickholt, said that so far the company had experienced “a limited number of failures” but that the company was working off “probabilistic assumptions” and “it is not so that I can say I know everything now”.

Investors were not reassured by the scale of cost-cutting, amid concerns that the company would need to raise more capital. Shares in Siemens Energy plunged 7.9pc.

British Airways boss: UK is being left behind on greener jet fuel production,"Rival countries are “getting ahead” of the UK in developing greener jet fuel, the boss of British Airways has warned.

Chief executive Sean Doyle urged the Government to consider what other nations are doing to encourage domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (Saf).

Transport Secretary Mark Harper insisted the UK is “on track” to meet its target of having at least five commercial Saf plants in construction by 2025.

US company Gulfstream Aerospace operated the first transatlantic flight powered by 100% Saf on Sunday.

The flight from its headquarters in Savannah, Georgia, to Farnborough, Hampshire, was carried out by a Gulfstream G600 business jet.

Gulfstream Aerospace said the flight “showcases the potential for aviation’s future use of renewable fuels”.

Saf is made from sustainable sources such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil, meaning it uses 70% less carbon than traditional jet fuel.

It is seen as vital to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon emissions but is currently several times more expensive to produce.

Speaking to an audience of aviation executives at the Airlines 2023 conference in Westminster, Mr Doyle said: “We’re struggling to really just get the ball rolling and getting plants built.

“Maybe we need to look at what other jurisdictions and governments are doing, who are getting ahead of us in that regard.”

The US has introduced a tax credit scheme to lure investors in Saf production.

British Aiways plane
Mr Doyle is the chief executive of British Airways (PA)
Under the Department for Transport’s (DfT) Saf mandate, at least 10% of the fuel used by airlines in the UK must be made from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

Without UK Saf production, meeting the mandate will rely heavily on imports.

There have been calls for the Government to introduce a way of reducing the difference in price between Saf and traditional jet fuel.

Mr Harper, who also appeared at the Airlines 2023 summit, said a consultation on a “revenue certainty mechanism” for Saf producers will be launched “soon”.

The Cabinet minister acknowledged “we must build Britain’s Saf base”.

He went on: “Recent years have shown the dangers of over-reliance on energy imports, holding us hostage to the whims of foreign tyrants.”

Mr Harper insisted the UK has invested “significant amounts of public money” into developing Saf, and is “not complacent”.

Last week the DfT awarded a total of £53 million to nine projects in the latest round of the Advanced Fuels Fund competition to develop Saf.

Saf can currently be used in jet engines to a maximum blend of 50% with kerosene without the need for any modifications.

Virgin Atlantic will become the first major airline to operate a transatlantic flight using 100% Saf on November 28.

Mr Harper, who will be among the passengers onboard, described the flight from London Heathrow to New York JFK as “historic” and claimed it “could unlock the future of aviation”."
British Airways’ green fuel project wins Government backing,"A partnership involving British Airways to develop lower carbon aviation fuels has secured a share of new Government funding.

The airline expressed hope that the investment will “help establish the UK as a world-leader” in the production of sustainable aviation fuels (Saf).

Project Speedbird – the carrier’s joint partnership with green fuel businesses Nova Pangaea Technologies and LanzaJet – secured a total of £9 million from the Government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) competition.

Saf is produced from sustainable sources such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper

It cuts carbon emissions by up to 70% compared with traditional jet fuel, but is currently several times more expensive to produce.

Project Speedbird is aimed at producing 102 million litres of Saf per year.

This would decrease CO2 emissions by 230,000 tonnes, which British Airways said is equivalent to around 26,000 domestic flights.

Some £53 million was shared by a total of nine projects in the latest round of the AFF competition to support the development of Saf in the UK.

Under the Department for Transport’s Saf mandate, at least 10% of the fuel used by airlines in the UK must be made from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: “The investment we’re announcing today demonstrates our confidence in the UK’s Saf industry – creating jobs, encouraging overseas investment and levelling up communities across the whole country.

“Thanks to this Government’s backing, the UK is quickly becoming a Saf superpower – ensuring people can continue to travel how they want, in a way that’s fit for the future.”

The development of Saf is seen as vital to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon emissions.

Several airline and airport bosses have expressed concern that the UK risks falling behind other nations in developing production facilities.

The US has introduced a tax credit scheme to lure investors in Saf production.

There have been calls for the UK Government to introduce a mechanism which would reduce the difference in price between Saf and traditional jet fuel.

Following the AFF funding announcement, British Airways director of sustainability Carrie Harris said: “Sustainable aviation fuel will play a critical role in meeting our net-zero targets and is currently the only realistic low carbon solution for long-haul flights, so it is vital that we continue to invest and develop Saf technology in order to create enough supply.

“We welcome the Government’s investment and continued support in Project Speedbird which represents landmark new technology for UK Saf supply.

“The UK has the potential to become a leader in the production of Saf, and this pioneering project is one step closer to this becoming a reality.”

Factbox-How European airlines have hedged against fuel price increases,"Higher oil prices amid turmoil in the Middle East are increasing prices of jet fuel, which accounts for a big portion of airlines' costs.

Brent crude oil almost hit $94 per barrel shortly after the Hamas attack in Israel on Oct. 7. It has since eased to around $77.

Spot Northwest European jet fuel prices were at $854 per metric ton, or around $108 per barrel, on Wednesday. That compares to a peak of over $128 per barrel in the week following the assault, and an all-time high of around $186 in June 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Some airlines use futures and options to hedge against price increases. They also try to hedge against value changes in the U.S. dollar, in which jet fuel is priced.

Here is how European airlines are hedged heading into 2024:

AIR FRANCE-KLM:

The CEO of the Franco-Dutch airline said on Oct. 27 it was ""quite sufficiently hedged"" for six months ahead.

The group has hedged 70% of its jet fuel consumption for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 64% for the first quarter of 2024, for $129.87 and $123.80 per barrel, respectively.

EASYJET:

The British discount airline said on Nov. 28 it had hedged 76% of its fuel needs for the first half of 2024 and 51% for the second, at an average cost of $109.75 and $104.18 per barrel, respectively. This was slightly higher than the $109.62 and $104.05 reported in October.

It has 76% of the dollars it expects to need in the first half of the year, bought at $1.22 per pound, and 53% for the second half at $1.24 per pound.

FINNAIR:

The Finnish carrier, which said in October its quarterly operating result was hurt by higher fuel prices, hedges its fuel purchases for 12 months on a rolling basis.

It has covered 159,000 tons of fuel for the first quarter at an average price of $116.20 per barrel, 126,000 tons for the second at $109.87 per barrel, and 87,000 tons for the third at $118.23 per barrel. At the end of September, this amounted to over 50% of Finnair's fuel purchases for the next 12 months, a company spokesperson told Reuters.

IAG:

The owner of British Airways and Iberia said in July it was 58% hedged for the first quarter, 49% for the second, 39% for the third, and 32% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Including currency risk, the group was hedged at $103.16 per barrel for the first and third quarters, and at $102.53 for the second and fourth quarters.

On Oct. 27, the group's CEO said IAG was well-hedged on jet fuel for the first and second quarters.

ICELANDAIR:

The Icelandic carrier said in October it had 20,500 tons of fuel hedged for passenger flights in the first quarter, or 33% of estimated total usage at $102.66 per barrel. It has hedged 26% of second-quarter usage at 26,500 tons for $106.33 per barrel, and 5% of third-quarter usage at 7,000 tons for $106.58 per barrel.

LUFTHANSA:

The German carrier said on Nov. 2 its ""high hedge ratio"" meant it was well protected against rising oil prices. Lufthansa has hedged 74% of the fuel it expects to need for 2024 at an average price of $120.38 per barrel.

NORWEGIAN AIR:

The Norwegian carrier said on Nov. 2 it had hedged about 35% of its fuel needs for 2024 ""at levels considerably below current forward prices"". As of November, it had hedged 138,700 tons of jet fuel at $102.4 per barrel for the first half of 2024 and 152,850 tons at $101.6 per barrel for the second half of 2024.

RYANAIR:

The Irish carrier said on Nov. 6 it had secured about 85% of its fuel requirements for 2024 at $89 per barrel, and over 50% for 2025 at $79 per barrel.

The airline has bought more than 90% of the dollars it expects to need for operating expenses next year at $1.08 per euro, and a half of those needed for 2025 at $1.12 per euro, it said.

SAS:

The biggest Scandinavian carrier said on Nov. 30 it had not hedged any of its fuel consumption for the next year. At the end of October, SAS had hedged 41% of the U.S. dollars it expects to use in the next 12 months. In terms of Norwegian crowns, SAS's largest surplus currency, 42% was hedged for the next year.

WIZZ AIR:

The Hungarian budget carrier had as of Nov. 6 hedged 70% of its 2024 fuel needs at a price ranging from $102.66 to $117.85 per barrel, and 38% of 2025 needs for $94.56 to $108.10 per barrel.

It has bought 69% of the dollars it expects to need for jet fuel in 2024 at $1.07 to $1.11 per euro, and 32% for 2025 at $1.09 to $1.14 per euro."
British Airways green aviation fuel developer scrambles to raise cash,"A business that turns waste into low-carbon aviation fuel is scrambling to raise cash after a large funding deal fell through.

Velocys, which previously partnered with British Airways, revealed on Tuesday that a planned $15m (£12.4m) investment from New York-based Carbon Direct Capital will no longer go ahead after the company failed to meet a target of raising $40m from other backers by the end of October.

In a stock market announcement, Velocys said: “It has become clear that any investment into the company resulting from these discussions is unlikely to be on the same terms.”

Velocys is currently developing a test site in partnership with British Airways to turn commercial and household waste into 20 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel.

This would be enough to power 1,000 flights from London to New York every year.

The company’s site at Immingham, Lincolnshire, received £27m from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund late last year.

Velocys’ process for creating sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, uses urban waste run through several chemical processes to make hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

These are then proceeded through the company’s reactor and catalyst to make jet fuel, diesel, and other hydrocarbons.

SAF can be used in existing jet engines with minor modifications but it is yet to be used comprehensively across the sector.

Using waste in this way means fewer methane emissions from landfills, although the process does produce carbon dioxide. Methane is considered a worse greenhouse gas than CO2.

Airlines including Virgin Atlantic have already used small amounts of biofuel mixed with regular jet fuel in testing and the airline is planning its first-ever transatlantic flight using only SAF in November.

About 3.4pc of Velocys is owned by Ervington Investments, which was previously controlled by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.

In Tuesday’s announcement, Velocys said it will need to reach a deal by the end of the year: “Velocys still anticipates that funding will be required before the end of this calendar year and therefore the board is prudently exploring near-term funding options as discussions with the strategic investors continue.”"
Ryanair threatens to scrap aircraft orders as Boeing crisis deepens,"Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has urged Boeing to get its s--- together as he threatened to abandon aircraft orders if the manufacturer does not deliver on time.

His warning comes just days after the US aviation giant revealed fresh delays to deliveries of its flagship 737 Max.

Setbacks at Boeing have already forced Ryanair to make changes to its winter schedule, disrupting holiday plans for up to 1.4m passengers.

Last week, Boeing said it expects to deliver between 375 and 400 of its narrow-body aircraft this year, which is lower than previous forecasts of 400 and 450.

Mr O’Leary has responded to the announcement by saying Ryanair could scrap orders if Boeing is unable to deliver another batch of planes in time for next summer.

He said: “Boeing needs to get its act together and start delivering these aircraft on time.

“I had a lot of sympathy for Boeing. The Max was grounded for two years but that was two years ago. It’s time for them to get their s--- together and start delivering these aircraft.”

Mr O’Leary said he was frustrated by delays as he wanted to capitalise on rival airlines being forced to ground jets because of faults discovered in Pratt & Whitney engines.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group revealed last week that 32 of its planes with Pratt & Whitney engines will be grounded.

“It is frustrating because the demand for travel is very strong and we think there are a lot of competitors who are going to be grounding their aircraft,” said Mr O’Leary.

“It is important that we get all of these aircraft so we can keep fares low and keep flying people while the competition is grounded.

“We’re working with Boeing to try and accelerate those deliveries. But the big issue for us is that we’re meant to get 57 aircraft by the end of April.

“We’re hoping to get them by the end of June but if they slip into July or August then it will be too late so we won’t take them.”

A Boeing spokesman said: “We value our partnership with Ryanair and are committed to supporting them.”"
Strong demand drives profits record at British Airways owner IAG,"The British Airways owner, IAG, has reported a jump in profits in the last quarter because of strong performances on its North and South Atlantic routes.

Operating profits rose to €1.745bn (£1.52bn) in the July-September quarter, up from €1.216bn in the third quarter of 2022, as IAG became the latest airline group to benefit from the boom in leisure travel.

Luis Gallego, the group’s chief executive, said: “This quarter represents a record third-quarter performance for IAG. This is allowing us to invest in the business and reduce a significant amount of our debt.

“During the third quarter we saw sustained strong demand across all our routes, in particular the North and South Atlantic and in all leisure destinations around Europe. We continue to develop our hubs of Barcelona, Dublin, London and Madrid, supported by our fleet deliveries and future orders.”

Flight capacity, measured in “available seat kilometres“ rose by 18% year on year, to96% of levels reported in Q3 2019, before the Covid pandemic.

IAG attributed the capacity rise to a focus over the summer on European holiday destinations and further investment across the South and North Atlantic, supported by 20 aircraft deliveries this year.

The cost of fuel dropped 6% compared with a year ago, and revenue per passenger rose 2.2% and is up by almost a quarter since 2019.

However, Gallego said the Israel-Hamas war has had an impact on revenue for flights to Egypt’s capital, Cairo, and to the Jordanian capital, Amman.

British Airways has suspended flights to and from Israel since 11 October. It had operated a single daily flight to Tel Aviv before the suspension, according to the tracking website Flightradar24.

Gallego told reporters on Friday: “We are very mindful of the geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties and in particular now the events that are happening in the Middle East. Regarding this terrible situation we see some limited revenue impact on flights to Cairo and Amman, and for sure Israel, but it’s too early to conclude if we’re going to have a wider strain and implications.”"
IAG profits up 56% due to ‘strong demand across all routes’,"British Airways owner IAG said its profit rose by 56% in the three months to the end of September as bosses hailed strong performances on its North and South Atlantic routes.

The business said pre-tax profit rose from just over one billion euro (£879 million) in the third quarter of last year to 1.6 billion euro (£1.4 billion) in the most recent quarter.

Flight capacity was up 17.9% and revenue rose 18.0% to 8.6 billion euro (£7.5 billion) during the period, IAG said.

The cost of fuel dropped 6.2% compared with a year ago while revenue per passenger rose 2.2% and is up by almost a quarter since 2019.

IAG reduced its gross debt by 2.4 billion euro (£2.1 billion) to 17.2 billion euro (£15.0 billion) in the three months to the end of September.

Chief executive Luis Gallego said: “This quarter represents a record third-quarter performance for IAG. This is allowing us to invest in the business and reduce a significant amount of our debt.

“During the third quarter we saw sustained strong demand across all our routes, in particular the North and South Atlantic and in all leisure destinations around Europe.

“We continue to develop our hubs of Barcelona, Dublin, London and Madrid, supported by our fleet deliveries and future orders.”

Mr Gallego said the Israel-Hamas conflict has had an impact on revenue for flights to Cairo and Amman, the capitals of Egypt and Jordan respectively.

British Airways has suspended flights to and from Israel since October 11.

Mr Gallego told reporters: “We are very mindful of the geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties and in particular now the events that are happening in the Middle East.

“Regarding this terrible situation we see some limited revenue impact on flights to Cairo and Amman, and for sure Israel, but it’s too early to conclude if we’re going to have a wider strain and implications.”"
The past five years for International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) investors has not been profitable,"Generally speaking long term investing is the way to go. But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. For example the International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (LON:IAG) share price dropped 77% over five years. That's an unpleasant experience for long term holders.

Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.

Check out our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group

To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During five years of share price growth, International Consolidated Airlines Group moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.

Arguably, the revenue drop of 7.8% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.

The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

International Consolidated Airlines Group is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think International Consolidated Airlines Group will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)

What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?
We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between International Consolidated Airlines Group's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Its history of dividend payouts mean that International Consolidated Airlines Group's TSR, which was a 60% drop over the last 5 years, was not as bad as the share price return.

A Different Perspective
We're pleased to report that International Consolidated Airlines Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over one year. That certainly beats the loss of about 10% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. Shareholders might want to examine this detailed historical graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.

"European airlines say sustainable fuel targets may mean higher fares, consolidation","European airline chiefs said on Thursday the industry needs to make more money and may consolidate further to pay for sustainability targets, a trend likely to lead to higher fares for passengers on top of rising demand for air travel.

The head of British Airways parent IAG told reporters at a CEO roundtable that there was a more than a 90% risk that the industry would not meet a European Union mandate for the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2025.

The European Union has adopted rules requiring flights departing from EU airports to carry a progressively increasing amount of SAF, starting with 2% of total fuel in 2025.

Gallego said Europe's tougher rules, compared to other regions, risked making its fragmented industry less competitive, putting pressure on airlines to continue a recent wave of partnerships.

""The problem we have in Europe is we have a small group or a small airline competing in a global war with mandates of sustainability that are ahead of others. We are not going to be competitive,"" Gallego said.

""So we need to consolidate the industry, you know, in order to afford all these, for example, sustainability ambitions that we have. And that's the reason why we are trying to be bigger, more efficient, and to develop better platforms for our customers.""

Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Brussels event, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary forecast more consolidation with IAG best placed to buy Portugal's TAP ahead of rivals Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.

He expressed surprise that Air France-KLM had bought a stake in Scandinavian SAS.

He also reiterated predictions that low-cost rivals Wizz Air and easyJet would fall to consolidation, with easyJet snapped up by IAG or Air France-KLM, or both, and Wizz Air getting bought by Lufthansa or a Middle Eastern buyer.

""Riyadh (Air) have lots of plans, but they have no access to aircraft,"" he said.

The comments drew a frosty response from easyJet. Other carriers were not immediately available for comment.

""Millions of consumers in Europe will be relieved to hear there is no realistic prospect of Ryanair becoming the only low cost airline in Europe,"" an easyJet spokesperson said."
EasyJet ‘cannot say’ when Israel flights will resume,"EasyJet hopes to resume flights to and from Israel “as soon as possible” but “cannot say” when it will happen, chief executive Johan Lundgren said.

The airline suspended its Tel Aviv operations after Hamas’s attack on Saturday.

Flights have been suspended until at least October 17.

In the UK, easyJet usually serves Gatwick, Luton and Manchester airports from Israel.

EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren
EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said Israel is ‘an important route to have in place’ (PA)
Mr Lundgren said the carrier will “continue to evaluate this on a daily basis”.

He added: “We are making our decisions (based) on a multiple number of sources. We are engaging with probably 10 or 12 different authorities, government authorities, security experts, alongside the expertise that we have within ourselves.

“We are making then a weighted decision on what it would take for us to start up again.

“We want to start up again. We believe it’s an important route to have in place.

“But for now, when we have weighed up all the information that we have, we have decided to continue to suspend the operation.”

Mr Lundgren said “a number of things” must happen for the airline to feel “comfortable” about resuming operations to and from Israel.

He added: “That is obviously something that we want to do as soon as possible but we cannot say now when that is.”

Mr Lundgren said the airline has not seen a reduction in demand for flights to other countries in the region, such as Egypt and Turkey.

He said: “I think that this is very much a specific issue locally from the demand point of view.”

On Wednesday, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic became the latest airlines to suspend flights between the UK and Israel.

British Airways flight BA165 returned to Heathrow after nearly reaching Tel Aviv before the decision was made.

There were reports Palestinian militant group Hamas fired multiple rockets towards Ben Gurion Airport.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay, when asked if there will be Government-sanctioned flights to bring back UK citizens, told Good Morning Britain: “At the moment there are still commercial flights but of course the Foreign Office keeps these issues under review.”"
Airline Vueling faces Italy antitrust probe on hand luggage fees,"Spanish low-cost airline Vueling is facing an antitrust investigation in Italy over hand luggage fees and online profiling, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) said on Wednesday.

According to the regulator, the carrier does not provide clear information to customers that the price for hand luggage varies depending on whether tickets are bought via its website or via its mobile app.

In addition, ""it would seem that the device used by the consumer is also used as a parameter to proceed with customer profiling in such a way as to differentiate the purchase price of the ticket,"" the AGCM said in a statement.

Such practices, if proven, could damage consumers by offering them ""incomplete, non-transparent and omissive information"" on how Vueling sets prices for luggage, the authority said.

Vueling said in a statement that its ""baggage pricing policy is transparent and complies with the regulations"", it ""does not distinguish between devices, nor between web or app channels"" and is properly advertised ""throughout the purchase process"".

It added that it would ""work closely"" with Italian authorities ""to provide all the necessary information and clarify any doubts"".

The Barcelona-based airline is part of the International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, among others.

In August, Spain's Ministry of Consumer Affairs said it had opened an investigation into Vueling and other low-cost airlines over hand luggage and other fees, which result in the price most consumers pay being higher than initially advertised."
Oil price leaps and airline shares fall after Hamas attack on Israel,"Oil and gas prices rose on Monday and airline shares fell amid widespread flight cancellations as markets reacted to the surprise attack on Israel by the militant group Hamas.

Investors appeared to be pricing in the prospect of more instability in the Middle East, given the warning from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that his country was embarking on a “long and difficult war”. The death toll has passed 1,100 since fighting started on Saturday and is rising.

Although Israel does not produce oil, concerns are growing that the conflict could exacerbate uncertainty in the region and affect the major producers Iran and Saudi Arabia. There could be further sanctions for Iran if it emerges that it aided Hamas in the attack. The conflict may also derail a deal normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia that reports had suggested could have led to the latter increasing its oil output.

Oil prices jumped by 4% by the time markets closed in London, with futures prices for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, at $88 (£72), recovering some of the losses of the previous week.

Gas prices also rose after Israel’s energy ministry ordered the shutdown of the Tamar natural gas field off the country’s coast. News of the shutdown pushed the European month-ahead gas benchmark up as much as 14.1% to €43.62 per megawatt hour. The UK day-ahead gas price soared by 19.5% to 95p a therm, with the month-ahead contract up 15% at 108.65p a therm.

The fossil fuel firms BP, Shell and Harbour Energy all rose in value on Monday, closing up 2.9%, 2.6% and 4.9% respectively. Shares in the London and Tel Aviv-listed oil and gas group Energean plunged by almost a fifth, making it Europe’s worst-performing stock on the day, although the company said its operations had not been affected by the fighting.

Israel’s central bank stepped in to support its currency after the shekel fell to a near eight-year low against the US dollar in early trading. The Bank of Israel said it would sell up to $30bn of foreign currency in the open market to maintain stability, helping the shekel to recover slightly.

Airlines were among the biggest fallers on Monday, with a number of airlines responding to the conflict by stopping flights to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport, Israel’s main international travel hub.

They included the US carriers Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines – which have each experienced a fall in market value of about 5% in early trading on Wall Street – plus Air Canada, Lufthansa and Air France.

British Airways changed its daily flights from Heathrow to Tel Aviv so they depart in the morning instead of the afternoon. It is understood this is to avoid crew having to stay overnight. A spokesperson said a flexible booking policy had been implemented so travellers can change their travel dates if they wish.

Ryanair, Europe’s biggest carrier by customer numbers, has cancelled all flights to Israel until at least Thursday, the budget carrier Wizz Air cancelled all flights to Tel Aviv until further notice, and easyJet cancelled flights on Sunday and Monday, adding it would alter its schedule for the rest of the week.

About 16% of flights into and out of Ben Gurion on Monday were cancelled, according to the data company FlightAware.

The share price of the BA owner International Airlines Group was down 6.1%, while easyJet fell by 5.8%. The Paris-listed Air France-KLM lost 7.8% and Germany’s Lufthansa lost 4.3%.

However, defence company shares strengthened in response to the fighting. BAE Systems rose by 4.5%, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. The company makes a wide range of weaponry, from tanks and fighter jets to ammunition and missiles.

The German tankmaker Rheinmetall rose by 6.5%, while the Italian defence and aerospace company Leonardo gained 4.8%.

Wall Street’s S&P 500 index of US-listed companies dipped o.2% in early trading, although defence and oil stocks rose. The US-based Northrop Grumman soared 11%, while Lockheed Martin rose 7.9%. The oil services firm Halliburton gained 6.7%, with Marathon Oil climbing 4.9%."

A Look At The Fair Value Of International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (LON:IAG),"Key Insights
The projected fair value for International Consolidated Airlines Group is UK£1.54 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

With UK£1.51 share price, International Consolidated Airlines Group appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value

Our fair value estimate is 32% lower than International Consolidated Airlines Group's analyst price target of €2.28

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (LON:IAG) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group

The Calculation
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €5.6b

After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 12%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €1.1b× (1 + 1.4%) ÷ (12%– 1.4%) = €10.0b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €10.0b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= €3.2b

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is €8.8b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK£1.5, the company appears about fair value at a 1.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.

Important Assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Consolidated Airlines Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.826. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Moving On:
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The regulator had been due to conclude the latest phase of its investigation into the partnership during the pandemic, but decided to stick with existing measures during a period when there was little flying due to COVID travel restrictions.

It said on Thursday it would spend six months analysing and reviewing information on the partnership between the airlines, called the Atlantic Joint Business Agreement.

The current interim measures directive expires in 2026."
"IAG chief sees Portugal's TAP as great fit, optimistic about privatisation","Portugal's soon to be privatised TAP airline would fit right into IAG's profile as a developer of airlines and hubs, also strengthening its existing operations, the CEO of the British Airways owner told Reuters on Wednesday.

""We'll have to study the process (of privatisation) and carefully consider the details, but we feel optimistic and believe that TAP can become another success story within IAG,"" Luis Gallego said on the sidelines of the World Aviation Festival in Lisbon.

Portugal's government is expected to approve the legal framework for the privatisation on Thursday. It has said it intends to keep a strategic stake in the carrier.

At least two other major global players - Lufthansa and Air France-KLM - have shown an interest in TAP.

IAG also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling.

Gallego said growth in Irish carrier Aer Lingus, which has more than doubled its long-haul capacity and added nine destinations in North America since its acquisition four years ago, could serve as a model for TAP. The acquisition also helped develop the Dublin hub.

""We can jointly develop the Lisbon hub and provide significant value to Portugal and the Portuguese people...Our networks are highly complementary with many opportunities to connect passengers from Lisbon to Latin America, North America and Africa,"" Gallego said.

TAP operates several routes to Brazil and connects Lisbon to Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa.

""Our hubs would feed into TAP's network from IAG's home bases: Dublin, London, Madrid and Barcelona,"" Gallego added.

In a nod to the Portuguese government's desire to preserve the national brand and the Lisbon hub, he said that under IAG's decentralised business model, each company maintains its cultural identity, board of directors and headquarters.

""The group provides scale, for example, for fleet negotiations and supplier procurement...it also provides access to investment,"" he said.

TAP CEO Luis Rodrigues told the same event he expected Thursday to be a ""big day"" for the company, adding: ""I think it (privatisation) is going to work fine"" as the airline expected to post positive results for the second consecutive year after swinging to a profit in 2022.

IAG's Gallego also said demand for travel was ""very, very strong"", except from the corporate sector, as it continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that the recovery of corporate demand in Spain was happening faster than in Britain."
"IndiGo expands codeshare network with British Airways, boosting India-UK connectivity","India's premier airline, IndiGo, announced on Friday a significant expansion of its codeshare network through a partnership with British Airways. The move is designed to strengthen connectivity between India and the UK, allowing British Airways to add more routes to the existing IndiGo network.

This strategy, known as code sharing, allows airlines to place their two-letter identification code on the flight schedules of their partners. This enables flights to be marketed by one airline while being operated by another. The new partnership with British Airways is an addition to IndiGo's already extensive list of codeshare agreements with international airlines such as Turkish Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and Air France.

Abhijit Dasgupta, Senior Vice President of Network Planning and Revenue Management at IndiGo, expects this latest partnership to stimulate trade and commerce between India and the UK.

In conjunction with the announcement of this new partnership, shares of IndiGo's parent company, Interglobe Aviation Limited (NSE:INDIGO), saw a 1% increase in early trading on Friday. The stock was priced at Rs 2,407 ($1 = INR82.940) per share following the news. Over the past six months, IndiGo's stock has risen by 27%, marking the highest gain among all airlines listed on the stock exchanges.

British Airways and Indigo Announce Codeshare Partnership to Boost India-Uk Connectivity,"British Airways and Gurugram-based air carrier IndiGo have announced a new codeshare partnership to enhance travel connectivity between India and the United Kingdom. The agreement, announced on Thursday, will enable travelers to book their entire journey on a single ticket, simplifying the travel process. The codeshare flights are available for booking from Thursday, for travel starting from October 12, 2023, subject to government approval.

Under the agreement, British Airways will extend its reach by incorporating its flight codes onto several routes within IndiGo's network. This includes new routes such as Thiruvananthapuram to London Heathrow via Mumbai, Rajkot to London Heathrow via Mumbai, and Vadodara to London Heathrow via Mumbai. Existing routes include Amritsar to London Heathrow via New Delhi, Kochi to London Heathrow via Mumbai, Ahmedabad to London Heathrow via Mumbai, Goa to London Heathrow via Mumbai, and Kolkata to London Heathrow via Mumbai.

Abhijit Dasgupta, Senior Vice President of Network Planning and Revenue Management at IndiGo, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership. He emphasized its potential to expand travel options for British Airways customers and promote trade, tourism, and student mobility between India and the UK.

Neil Chernoff, Director of Network and Alliances at British Airways, highlighted the airline's long-standing commitment to serving India since 1924. He noted that this partnership with IndiGo will enhance convenience and flexibility for travelers.

British Airways currently operates 56 weekly flights to five Indian cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. Passengers traveling between Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore can enjoy the newly designed Club Suite (business class) cabin. Additionally, British Airways is set to unveil its first new uniform in two decades for its cabin crew, pilots, and check-in agents.

IndiGo, with its fleet of A320 aircraft, has a robust domestic and regional network in India. British Airways passengers flying on codeshare flights to India will benefit from complimentary meals and the airline's baggage allowance in economy class, which includes two checked bags weighing up to 23 kg per person. The carrier also has an order backlog of nearly 1,000 Airbus A320neo-family aircraft."
The Returns On Capital At International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) Don't Inspire Confidence,"If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, from a first glance at International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for International Consolidated Airlines Group, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.14 = €3.1b ÷ (€43b - €21b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).

So, International Consolidated Airlines Group has an ROCE of 14%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 14%.

Above you can see how the current ROCE for International Consolidated Airlines Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us
In terms of International Consolidated Airlines Group's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 18% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.

On a side note, International Consolidated Airlines Group's current liabilities are still rather high at 49% of total assets. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.

In Conclusion...
In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that International Consolidated Airlines Group is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. However, despite the promising trends, the stock has fallen 62% over the last five years, so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us.

While International Consolidated Airlines Group doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform.

Government and British Airways face legal action by Kuwait hostages,"British Airways passengers and crew members taken hostage in Kuwait in 1990 are preparing to take legal action against the UK Government and the airline, according to a law firm.

McCue Jury and Partners said it is representing victims who want to ensure “the truth is fully disclosed” and “due compensation is paid” for allowing the flight to land.

British Airways Flight 149 touched down at Kuwait International Airport in the early hours of August 2 1990 as Iraqi armed forces were invading.

More than 300 people onboard were detained by Iraqi troops, marking the start of an ordeal lasting almost five months as they were used by Saddam Hussein as “human shields” against western attacks.

The UK Government insisted the “responsibility” for what happened “lies entirely” with the Iraqi authorities at the time, while BA said it was “not warned about the invasion”.

Documents released in November 2021 showed the Foreign Office was warned by the British ambassador in Kuwait that Iraqi forces had crossed the border an hour before the flight landed.

The information was never passed to BA, which was unable to take action to divert the flight, according to the Foreign Office files released to the National Archives.

There have been claims that a group of around 10 men who were the first to disembark when the plane landed were special forces troops, but this has always been denied by the UK Government.

But McCue Jury and Partners said “evidence exists” that the Government and BA “knew the invasion had already begun” when they allowed the plane to land because it was being used to insert a team into Kuwait “for a special military operation”.

The firm is appealing for more passengers and crew members of the flight to join the claim, which it intends to bring in the High Court in London in the coming months.

It said each of the hostages “may claim an estimated average of £170,000 each in damages”.

Matthew Jury, managing partner of McCue Jury and Partners, said: “The lives and safety of innocent civilians were sacrificed by the British Government and British Airways for the sake of an off-the-books military operation.

“Both have concealed and denied the truth for more than 30 years.

“The victims and survivors of Flight BA149 deserve justice for being treated as disposable collateral.”

Some of the hostages suffered post-traumatic stress after being subjected to abuse and witnessing atrocities.

One of the passengers taking part in the claim is Barry Manners, who was a 24-year-old businessman at the time of the flight.

He said: “We were not treated as citizens, but as expendable pawns for commercial and political gain.

“A victory over years of cover-up and bare-faced denial will help restore trust in our political and judicial process.”

A Government spokesman said: “The Government has always condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the suffering that followed and the mistreatment of those aboard BA149.

“The responsibility for these events and the mistreatment of those passengers and crew lies entirely with the government of Iraq at the time.”

A BA spokesman said: “?Our hearts go out to all those caught up in this shocking act of war just over 30 years ago, and who had to endure a truly horrendous experience.

“UK Government records released in 2021 confirmed British Airways was not warned about the invasion.”"
Willie Walsh interview: ‘The transition to net zero is going to cost holidaymakers’,"The summer getaway is what most of us look forward to all year – preferably to somewhere warm with cocktails at hand. Not so, however, for Willie Walsh. “Hell, for me, would be lying on a beach in the sun,” the Irishman deadpans. “First and foremost, I would be bored stupid. And I would burn. It’s just torture – I can’t do it.”

This is something of a surprise, given that Walsh – who ran British Airways and its parent for 15 years– has devoted his career to getting the rest of us to our holidays. He reckons that he’s barely taken a week’s holiday since 2005 – when he took the controls at BA – and most of that was in the past year. Previously, he has admitted to working 100 days straight and even on Christmas Day.

Now, however, life is slightly more relaxed, after Walsh took a job as head of the Geneva-based International Air Transport Association (IATA). So will he now take a proper holiday? Err, no.

“I love working, you know?” the 61-year-old shrugs. Is it possible he could be a bit of a workaholic?

“It’s not necessarily that I’m a workaholic,” he insists, not entirely convincingly. “I just like being active. And work is an easy way to be active.”

This is Walsh, in a nutshell. And it explains a lot, given that he’s spent the past 20 years successfully steering some of Europe’s biggest airlines through storm after storm.

Willie Walsh
Willie Walsh became CEO of British Airways in 2005 - Nick Morrish
Having first trained as a pilot with Irish airline Aer Lingus, Walsh rose to become chief executive of the carrier in 2001, during the aftermath of 9/11, before taking the controls at a struggling British Airways four years later, fixing its finances and combining the business with a rival to form International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), an industry titan. He left IAG in 2020 to take his current job in Switzerland, where he now lives.

When I speak to Walsh over a video call, he’s in a relaxed mood, sitting in his whitewashed, sparsely decorated office overlooking the runways of Geneva Airport. There are no clues about his previous lives on the walls; even the model plane on his desk was left behind by a predecessor. He is more occupied with the present: the threat of strike action looms again over Gatwick this summer and across the Channel, French air traffic control staff have vowed industrial action.

It comes after television screens were filled last month with pictures of holidaymakers fleeing Rhodes and Corfu, as wildfires ripped through parts of the popular Greek islands. And if that weren’t enough, there’s a cost of living crisis.

Yet for Walsh, and the rest of the industry, this is practically a tea party compared with what came before. After all, the previous three summers were plagued by mass industrial action (2022), Covid travel requirements (2021) and lockdowns (2020).

“The picture’s slightly more disruptive than it was in 2019 but it’s a lot better than it was last year,” Walsh says. “There will be some disruption, but most flights are getting away.”

After surviving pandemic turbulence – during which some top carriers looked as though they would collapse – the aviation industry is on course to turn its first annual profit since 2019, following more than $180 billion (£140 billion) of cumulative losses. Demand is back to about 95 per cent of pre-pandemic levels in Europe and IATA estimates it will have recovered fully by next year.

The worst damage suffered by airlines during Covid was to their balance sheets, as they were forced to take on huge debts to keep going while flights were grounded. “It’s going to take some time for that to be recouped,” adds Walsh. “But the recovery has certainly been stronger than we had expected.”

Despite a recent warning by budget carrier Ryanair that price cuts may be necessary this winter to prop up ticket sales, Walsh is not worried by the gloomy economic climate. Employment remains high and families are still desperate to travel after years of Covid restrictions, he says, brushing off concerns.

“People in employment tend to continue to want to take their holiday. There’s still very strong underlying demand for air travel, and I expect that to continue.”

One thing that is on his radar, however, is the rising cost of air fares, which have jumped higher since the pandemic. At Ryanair, for example, the average fare per passenger was €37 (£32) in 2019, but jumped to €49 in April to June this year – a whopping 32 per cent increase.

Walsh says this is largely owing to rises in the cost of jet fuel – the single biggest cost for airlines – as well as a shortage of seat capacity, made worse when the pandemic forced carriers to cut back – and still a problem today because of aircraft delivery delays.

What’s more, the push towards net zero will only put further upward pressure on prices. The industry, led by IATA, has pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and, most notably, will involve switching from kerosene jet fuel to more sustainable – and expensive – alternatives.

Willie Walsh
‘There’s still very strong underlying demand for air travel, and I expect that to continue’ - Siggi Bucher
Does Walsh think the days of super-cheap flights will ever return? “They were always headline figures to stimulate interest in flying. But no, I don’t think we’ll see that again – and I think even Michael [O’Leary, the boss of Ryanair] would acknowledge that.”

In fact, the cost of transitioning to green fuels is expected to push up airfares by 10-20 per cent over the next couple of decades, says Walsh. And this comes from someone who is seen as an advocate of green issues within the industry – albeit perhaps a clear-eyed one. “Anybody who thinks that the transition to net zero isn’t going to cost is misled,” Walsh says. “Prices will have to go up... and that cost is something that ultimately will get passed through to consumers.”

He is withering, however, about suggestions that the green agenda equates to the death of mass air travel, putting him at odds with climate campaigners who say we should take the train to European destinations.

Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish activist, is among them – but the much higher price of rail travel makes her example difficult to emulate for many. Taking the 10-hour rail journey from London to Barcelona can be 10 times more expensive than the equivalent flight, with air fares starting from as little as €12.99, compared with train tickets all priced in excess of €300, according to research by Greenpeace.

The debate about whether this kind of shift is really useful or just virtue signalling has spawned a new lexicon of words, including “flight shame” and “train bragging”. This year, France has banned domestic flights that can be done in less than two-and-a-half hours by train, while the Austrian government has phased out flights between Vienna and Salzburg, and Germany has doubled taxes on short-haul services.

Should we feel ashamed to fly short distances? “This is a much more nuanced debate than the one I think some people have wanted to engage in,” Walsh sighs. Aviation accounted for 2 per cent of global emissions in 2022, though scientists say it has a disproportionately large effect on the atmosphere. Walsh, however, points to a 2021 study by Eurocontrol, which found that axing all flights of less than 500km would only shave 4 per cent off the continent’s total carbon emissions.

This is because the vast majority of emissions come from long-haul flights. “So the idea that the way to address environmental impacts is to stop all short-haul flying – it’s nonsense.

Walsh’s biggest legacy is likely to be his masterminding of the merger of BA with Spanish airline Iberia to form IAG

“And then, of course, people have the perception that train travel is extremely efficient but that depends on how the trains are powered. If you’re using old diesel locomotives, that’s not the same as using electricity that’s generated by a nuclear power station, for example.”

He is also highly critical of the cost of rail – in terms of both fares and infrastructure – and service levels. “There’s a decent rail network in Spain and in France; in Switzerland where I’m living now it’s pretty good. But if you look at some other countries like Germany, it’s awful.” He cites examples of recent rail travel experiences in Germany (two trains cancelled, others late) and between Geneva and Paris (late without explanation, terrible service and Wi-Fi that didn’t work).

“In many cases, train travel is very expensive. Look at the cost of the development of new infrastructure – it’s huge. The debate [about High Speed 2] in the UK is actually interesting, when you look at the opposition both from an environmental point of view and the cost, which is astronomical.

“The idea that you’ll be able to provide an alternative rail option for people to travel, it’s just not going to happen.” By contrast, he says, airlines pay for most of their own infrastructure and do not receive government subsidies. But he accepts that the airline industry has to clean up its own record.

“The facts matter in this debate, but the perception of our industry is one that we have to deal with rather than the reality. And the perception is that the industry needs to do more in terms of its impact on climate change – and we will. We’ll do that by addressing the environmental impact through the use of sustainable aviation fuel in the short to medium term, and then technology beyond the 2050 period will provide the solution.

“But I think as we transition, flying will continue to be a valid option for people for many, many years to come.”

Cross swords with Walsh, and it’s not hard to see where he gets his reputation as a ruthless combatant. When he took over at Aer Lingus in 2001, the carrier was on the verge of collapse and his previous boss had been ousted in a harassment scandal. In response, Walsh rammed through cost-cutting measures, axed travel agent commissions, nixed business class on short-haul flights and faced down union chiefs.

He left in 2005 after falling out with the Irish government over proposals to float the airline on the stock exchange, but was then headhunted by BA and employed a similar playbook to knock the beleaguered business – which he described as “a pension fund with wings” – back into shape.

His all-out assault on waste earned Walsh the tabloid nickname “Slasher” – and years later he was also blamed for BA dispensing with frills such as free food and drink. A reduction in leg room was also held up by critics as an example of how Walsh’s reforms had left Britain’s flag carrier, once the envy of the world, looking more threadbare.

It was at BA, however, that Walsh masterminded what is likely to be his biggest legacy: the merger of BA with Spanish airline Iberia to form IAG, which later grew to swallow Spanish low-cost carriers Vueling and Air Europa, as well as Aer Lingus. Walsh set the group up with a “Darwinian” structure that forces its various airlines to compete among themselves for the company’s resources.

Colleagues and union chiefs describe an uncompromising negotiator, who will fix you across the table with a piercing “dead-eyed stare”. Revealingly, Walsh himself has been known to quote the writer George Bernard Shaw, saying: “A reasonable man gets nowhere in negotiations.”

In person, you wouldn’t know any of this. Walsh is charming, upbeat and self-deprecating, although you get the sense there is steel beneath the affable exterior. Does he think his reputation as the ruthless “slasher” is fair? “I think there’s more to me. But I’ve never been bothered about what the media say or write.

“Being a pilot has been helpful, because you learn about the need for close teamwork… and you have to make decisions – you don’t have the luxury of being able to say, ‘Well, hang on, we’ll think about that tomorrow’.

“For some people, they struggle, particularly when it comes to tough decisions. I’ve never had that problem. And I think that’s where some of this image of the slasher comes from.

“When I took over at Aer Lingus, the belief and expectation was that the company would be bankrupt within a couple of months. So yes, we did take a hatchet to the business – but we kept it in business. Do I think I got everything right? I would be extremely foolish to believe that. But you know, in general, I’m pleased.”

His proudest moment remains flying a BA plane towards the volcanic ash cloud that loomed over Iceland in 2010 to show it was safe, a daring stunt that eventually forced the UK government to back down and reopen the country’s airports. “I certainly enjoyed playing brinkmanship with the politicians,” Walsh grins.

William Matthew Walsh was born in Dublin in 1961, the second eldest of five children. His father Martin was a self-employed glazier and used to let a young Willie take apart his car, something his son would later credit for inspiring his interest in engineering and aviation.

Walsh got his break in airlines when he spotted a newspaper advertisement from Aer Lingus, looking for cadet pilots. He got the job but later discovered, after rising to become chief executive, that one of the interview panellists had thought him a “cocky little b------”.

Why does Walsh think he ended up having such an extraordinary career? “Genuinely, a lot of luck. And taking the opportunities when they came along. With Aer Lingus, there was no competition for the [chief executive] job – I happened to be in the right place at the right time.

“There were people who were better qualified but they didn’t want to do it because they were afraid of it going bankrupt. I didn’t think that way. I thought, there’s a job that needs to be done. And I’m happy to do it.”

Walsh’s financial prudence extends to his personal life, and he struggles to think of any extravagant purchases except a boat he previously kept on the Thames (now sold). He prefers to spend on good wine and nice meals out, and when he is in Dublin he relaxes with the friends he grew up with over a pint of Guinness.

Within the industry, he has long been friendly with Ryanair chief executive “frenemy” O’Leary, who he has mutual admiration for, but for years he feuded with Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson. They have both joked about kneeing each other in the groin, perhaps a little too convincingly. Isn’t it time they buried the hatchet?

“Yeah, I would. You know, if I met him, I would certainly say hello and let him buy me a nice bottle of wine,” Walsh concedes. Take note, Sir Richard.

Then Walsh lets slip another shocker: he is now mulling retirement.

Surely they’ll have to drag him out kicking and screaming? “No, no, no,” he insists. “I’ve seen too many people dragged out. I’ve got two more years to do here, then I think it’ll be a nice time for me to retire. And I fully intend to.

“Of course, I fully intended to retire before, to go off and see what Tokyo was like and, you know, travel around a bit.”

Somehow, it is quite hard to picture this being enough for Walsh. As far as breaks go, however, it would certainly be well-earned."
"BA staff secure 13.1% pay increase and £1,000 one-off payment, says Unite","British Airways (BA) workers have secured a 13.1% pay increase, trade union Unite has said.

Staff at the airline will receive the pay increase over an 18-month period, as well as a £1,000 one off payment.

The pay offer was “overwhelmingly” accepted by Unite members after a ballot was held, the trade union added.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “This is a sizable pay increase which has been achieved by the hard work and dedication of the union’s reps and officers, hammered out in detailed negotiations.

“The fact that Unite has reversed the fire and rehire cuts while also securing a large increase in pay, underlines how the union’s relentless focus on the jobs, pay and conditions of members, is delivering for workers financially.”

BA has been contacted for comment.

It comes after the parent company of BA made a record operating profit between January and June.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) announced last month that its operating profit in the first half of 2023 reached 1.3 billion euros (£1.1 billion), up from a loss of 446 million euros (£383 million) in the same period last year.

Revenue reached 13.6 billion euros (£11.7 billion), an increase of nearly 45% year-on-year.

Fares were up by an average of around 9.5%, while fuel prices increased by 5.7%.

IAG added that the capacity of its flights has been restored to 94% of pre-pandemic levels."
British Airways gives staff bumper 13pc pay rise after Covid cuts,"Staff at British Airways have secured a pay rise worth more than 13pc, reversing cuts rolled out at the height of the pandemic.

Around 24,000 employees at the airline will receive a 13.1pc increase in pay over an 18-month period, as well as a one-off payment of £1,000, the Unite union said.

The union said the deal, which excludes pilots and management, restores and increases pay after British Airways used so-called “fire and rehire” tactics during the pandemic, leading to many workers suffering pay cuts.

It said there was potential for pay to increase further, while no member of staff will have the pay increase applied at a lower rate of pay than they were receiving in 2020.

Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said: “This is a sizeable pay increase which has been achieved by the hard work and dedication of the union’s reps and officers, hammered out in detailed negotiations.

“The fact that Unite has reversed the fire and rehire cuts while also securing a large increase in pay, underlines how the union’s relentless focus on the jobs, pay and conditions of members, is delivering for workers financially.”

In addition to the pay increase, Unite said it had secured “milestone reviews” and additional pay rises for specific groups of workers at the company.

It comes amid chaos for European airlines as walkouts across the industry fuel a sharp rise in delays.

Repeated strikes by air traffic controllers in France have added to airspace congestion across the continent, forcing budget carriers Ryanair and easyJet to cancel thousands of flights.

British Airways narrowly avoided disruption after a wave of industrial action by ground handlers at ASC, Menzies Aviation and GGS was cancelled.

Another round of strikes by baggage handlers working with easyJet at London Gatwick has been suspended after Unite received a better pay offer.

British Airways has been contacted for comment."
British Airways staff to receive 13% pay rise - union,"Around 24,000 British Airways staff are set to receive a pay rise of 13.1% over 18 months, the Unite trade union said on Friday, with the award reflecting the country's high inflation level and the bounce back in travel post-pandemic.

Unite said in a statement that the deal also included a 1,000 pound one-off payment and the potential for pay to rise further during the period if inflation remains high.

British inflation hit a 41-year high of 11.1% last year and has fallen more slowly than in other countries, dropping to 7.9% in June, the highest of any major economy.

Employees at British Airways, which is owned by parent company IAG, had been balloted on the 13.1% offer and accepted it, Unite said.

To survive the pandemic, British Airways was forced to cut over 10,000 employees, but it has since taken on thousands more staff as demand for travel reaches 2019 levels. Last week, IAG's quarterly profit beat analyst forecasts by 40%.

""This agreement reverses BA’s highly controversial decision at the height of the COVID pandemic to hire and refire its entire workforce, with many workers suffering substantial pay cuts. Put simply, this both restores and increases pay,"" Unite said."
Taxman targets British Airways Avios points in crackdown,"Holidaymakers buying extra British Airways Avios points are at risk of being taxed for the first time as HMRC launches a raid on the popular frequent flyer programme.

Tax officials have told BA’s parent company, IAG, that it is reviewing how VAT is charged on Avios points.

Avios points are currently exempt from the sales tax as they are classified as air miles. Most points are also awarded for either flying with British Airways or spending on a BA-branded credit card.

However, the airline also allows people to purchase additional Avios points directly in order to top up their balance to meet levels needed for flights. Avios points can also be spent on things beyond air travel.

IAG revealed on Friday that HMRC had contacted the company weeks ago to say it believed Avios points should be taxed when they are bought.

IAG said: “HMRC’s emerging view asserts that charges made by IAG Loyalty are for participating / membership in the Avios scheme and the associated charges are subject to VAT.”

Alan Pearce, a partner at the accountancy Blick Rothenberg, said that the spending of Avios points on items other than flights may have influenced HMRC’s view that “this is an area where the VAT treatment is incorrect”.

It raises the prospect that BA customers who want to top up their Avios balance to reach a level needed to buy a flight may have to pay more, with tax added on top of the price of points.

Dan Neidle, a tax expert at Tax Policy Associates, said an HMRC ruling against the airline company could also “increase the costs for some businesses who award Avios points”.

He added: “That cost would then inevitably be passed on to the consumer.”

British Airways customers currently collect points based on how far they fly with the airline. They can also get Avios rewards for booking hotels or package holidays, while the airline has a deal with American Express that grants fliers one point for every £1 spent. Each point is typically worth between 0.8p and 1p in rewards.

The airline also sells Avios points to consumers directly and offers monthly subscriptions for Avios rewards, which start at £26 per month.

It was not immediately clear whether HMRC planned to claim VAT on all Avios collections, since air miles are not typically VAT-rated. IAG refused to comment further on the investigation and has not provided an estimate for the potential tax bill. HMRC declined to comment.

Rob Burgess, the editor of flying website Head For Points, said IAG has been allowing customers to spend the points on rewards other than flights while also offering subscriptions to buy them.

He said: “If IAG is selling you Avios for cash, which you can then spend on wine, then arguably there is no travel angle and no zero rated angle.”

Avios points were introduced in 2011, replacing British Airways’ air miles programme. They can be earned on flights with the UK airline and with IAG’s other carriers, including Aer Lingus and Iberia, or by spending on BA-branded American Express cards.

British Airways has more than 7 million members of its “executive” rewards club who collected more than 100 billion Avios points in 2022. Customers spend £40bn each year on points.

Earlier this month, British Airways changed how fliers collect Avios points, instead rewarding consumers with points for every pound spent, rather than based on the distance they fly.

The business is a major earner for IAG, bringing in revenues of £851m last year and profits of £235m.

IAG said it believed it had “strong arguments to support its VAT accounting” for Avios. It added that any decision from HMRC could be challenged at a tribunal.

The airline group said it was told about HMRC’s new interpretation of VAT charges in recent weeks. It said the taxman had not decided whether this charge would be “retroactive”, meaning it could try to claw back millions of pounds in VAT.

HMRC has launched a series of crackdowns in recent years, targeting ride-hailing company Uber over its VAT payments and launching more investigations into how companies record R&D tax credits.

The taxman has increased the number of inquiries it makes into companies over payments. There has also been a dramatic rise in the number of inheritance tax inquiries.

It has been under pressure to recoup lost tax revenues, after parliament’s spending watchdog estimated that a sharp fall in investigations during the Covid pandemic cost the Exchequer up to £9bn.

Disclosure of the tax investigation came as IAG reported half-year revenues of €13.5bn in the first six months of the year, up from €9.3bn in 2022. It also swung to a €1.2bn operating profit after making a loss in the same period last year."
British Airways owner announces record profits for first half of 2023,"International Airlines Group has announced record profits for the first half of 2023, with air fares up almost 10% on last year.

The British Airways owner said it expected its flight capacity across the group to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, with booming demand pushing it to a half-yearly operating profit of €1.3bn (£1.1bn) from losses of €446m (£383m) for the first six months of 2022.

The BA chief executive, Sean Doyle, said the airline was much more resilient than it was last year and had “navigated through to the end of July, I think at a much better place”.

French air traffic control strikes were still causing disruption, with BA particularly affected because its flights out of Heathrow and Gatwick rely heavily on crossing French airspace.

Summer 2022 was marked by significant upheaval, with BA forced to cancel thousands of flights due to labour shortages, especially at its main Heathrow hub.

The airline said it was building resilience against further disruption by recruiting 4,000 people so far in 2023, mainly in ground operations, and leasing additional aircraft with crew.

Doyle said the airline was not yet seeing any effects on bookings from the summer heatwave, which has brought extreme temperatures to much of southern Europe and the US. He said the coronavirus pandemic had taught BA to be “agile” in rerouting, but added: “I think it’s too early to gauge if fundamental demand patterns are changing. Traditional markets of southern Europe are very, very strong this year and actually they continue to book strongly.”

IAG said leisure demand remained strong across all its airlines – which include Aer Lingus and the Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling – for the summer months, with about 80% of seats already booked until the end of September.

While capacity has returned across the group, the number of long-haul and premium seats flown by BA is expected to remain below pre-Covid levels until 2025 and 2026, after the airline retired its 747 jumbos during the pandemic. BA announced it was ordering another six Boeing 787 Dreamliners to meet returning demand.

Luis Gallego, the chief executive of IAG, said: “Our strong profits since the start of the year are helping to fund investment for our customers, and to improve our balance sheet by reducing debt. We don’t see any sign of a slowdown in the demand.”"
British Airways’ parent company reports record operating profit as fares soar,"The parent company of British Airways made a record operating profit between January and June, it has announced.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) said its operating profit in the first half of 2023 reached 1.3 billion euros (£1.1 billion), up from a loss of 446 million euros (£383 million) in the same period last year.

Revenue reached 13.6 billion euros (£11.7 billion), an increase of nearly 45% year-on-year.

Fares were up by an average of around 9.5%, while fuel prices increased by 5.7%.

IAG said the capacity of its flights has been restored to 94% of pre-pandemic levels.

It attributed this to a “strong leisure traffic recovery”, noting the premium leisure segment “continued to perform very well”.

IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said: “Our strong profits since the start of the year are helping to fund investment for our customers, and to improve our balance sheet by reducing debt.

“We are aiming to be back to pre-pandemic capacity at the end of this year.

“These results are thanks to a strong performance from all companies across the group, and we would like to thank our teams for their hard work during the year so far.

“Customer demand remains strong across the group, particularly for leisure travel, with around 80% of passenger revenue for the third quarter already booked.

“And our airlines have put in place plans to support operations during the busy summer period.”

Asked about fares, Mr Gallego said IAG expects its revenue to be “even better” between July and September.

He said: “We don’t see any sign of a slowdown in the demand.

“I think that the performance of the group is going to continue in the way that you see now.”

IAG acknowledged that “some of our operations are not where we would want them to be and this is affecting our overall customer service”.

It said French air traffic control strikes are affecting most of its airlines – which consist of Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Level and Vueling – while global supply chain issues are “reducing aircraft availability”.

The company said British Airways is “particularly affected” due to its “London exposure and complex schedule”.

IAG said it has responded to the challenges by recruiting 4,000 people in the first half of the year with a “particular focus on ground operations” and is leasing eight aircraft with crew from other airlines."
"British Airways-owner IAG beats forecasts, but wary on outlook","IAG's quarterly profit beat analyst forecasts by 40% and the British Airways owner said the outlook for summer travel was encouraging, although it was ""mindful"" of uncertainty in the wider economy.

Leisure travel has boomed since pandemic restrictions ended last year, driving up ticket prices and boosting profits for airlines despite the squeeze on household incomes from high inflation and rising interest rates.

Air France-KLM on Friday also reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings.

But there are signs that momentum could be slowing and the winter could be tougher. Earlier this week, Ryanair was cautious on demand for the rest of 2023.

IAG, which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, said it was ""mindful of wider uncertainties that might affect the full year"", which chief executive Luis Gallego told reporters referred to a lack of visibility on the fuel price and demand.

But so far, IAG had not seen ""any weakness into Q3 and Q4"", finance chief Nicholas Cadbury added.

Shares in IAG, which have climbed 25% this year, were up 2.6% to 159 pence in early deals, still well below the 400 pence level they were trading at before the pandemic in early 2020.

IAG did not provide an update on its full-year guidance on Friday. In May, it said it expected annual profit above 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion), and analysts' consensus forecast stands at 2.8 billion euros.

For the three months to the end of June, the group recorded an operating profit before exceptional items of 1.25 billion euros, compared to the 895 million euros analysts were on average expecting.

""These numbers will help push expectations for this year strongly through the 3 billion euro operating profit level,"" Goodbody analysts said.

IAG said it was 30% booked for the October-December period, which is typical for this time of year, and for now its focus was on delivering resilient operations over the summer given the air traffic control and labour dispute challenges in Europe."
Airlines in £700m slump as European wildfires throw summer holidays into doubt,"Almost £700m was wiped off the value of London-listed airline stocks on Monday as family summer holidays were thrown into doubt by heatwaves and wildfires gripping Europe.

Shares in Easyjet, British Airways-owner IAG, TUI, Wizz Air and Jet2 sunk lower as Greek authorities stepped up tourist evacuations from the popular resort islands of Rhodes and Corfu where blazes were sweeping across the countryside.

Wizz Air shed 6.3pc, with Easyjet finishing 4.7pc lower and Jet2 down 4.4pc. TUI and IAG closed down 3.4pc and 1.8pc respectively.

The London-listed travel stocks collectively shed £694m in value, according to Bloomberg terminal data.

EasyJet, Jet2 and TUI were among those to confirm they were sending repatriation flights for British tourists to Greece on Monday.

Alex Macheras, an independent aviation analyst, said extreme weather was becoming yet another risk airlines were having to plan for each summer, with strikes also hampering air traffic control operations and the Ukraine war still affecting some flight paths.

He said: “Air travel is vulnerable to just about everything, from security risks to weather and climate-related issues and of course geopolitical issues.

“Unfortunately, these wildfires and heat waves are just another thing to add to an already-long list.”

As well as the wildfires, investors were also spooked by a warning from budget carrier Ryanair that demand for air fares risks cooling as households grapple with surging mortgage payments.

The Irish carrier also cut its full year passenger growth forecast to 183.5 million, down from previous guidance for 185 million, blaming delays in deliveries of new Boeing aircraft.

Ryanair warned that demand for last-minute bookings had softened in late June and early July. The budget airline said it might need to lower fares this winter to boost takeup as higher interest rates squeezed household budgets.

Neil Sorahan, the airline’s finance chief, said: “What we have found in previous slowdowns - if you go back to the global financial crisis - is that people didn’t stop travelling, they just became more price-conscious.

“The question mark is: Will we have to stimulate pricing or not to fill the planes? I don’t know whether we will have to do so in winter or not.”

The weak outlook sent Ryanair’s shares down 6pc in Dublin.

The slump came despite the airline announcing it had almost quadrupled its profits in the three months to the end of June, thanks to booming demand over Easter and the coronation weekend.

Ryanair made a profit of £574m in its first quarter, up from £147m a year earlier.

Fares were 42pc higher, while passenger traffic grew 11pc against weak comparisons a year earlier when demand was impacted following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Mr Sorahan said employment remained high, meaning workers retained paid annual leave and were “still very keen to use that”.

He added that Ryanair would be able to grow market share if fares came under pressure in the months ahead.

Mr Sorahan said: “That’s really where our model comes into its own. You know, our average fare in the quarter just ended was €49, which puts us in the price bracket of most people.

“So given the cost advantage that we have over everybody else, given the strength of the balance sheet, that gives us a big opportunity to go out and grow market share if there is a pullback.”

Despite potential price cuts over winter, Mr Sorahan said average air fares were set to remain above pre-Covid levels for up to four years following cutbacks in capacity during the pandemic."
BA owner invests in green aviation fuel made from straw and sawdust,"The owner of British Airways has invested in a green aviation fuel producer based in Teesside as the airline industry races to meet net zero targets.

IAG, the FTSE 100 group behind the UK flag carrier, Aer Lingus and Spain’s Iberia, is to invest in Nova Pangaea Technologies, which is building its headquarters within the Teesside Freeport.

Nova Pangaea has developed technology to turn waste products such as wheat straw, sawdust and leftover wood trimmings into feedstock to create so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAF has a far lower carbon footprint than current jet fuel and is seen as the best way to cut the environmental impact of the aviation industry.

However, production is currently small-scale, and industry is pushing to rapidly ramp up supply to meet net zero targets.

IAG’s investment in Nova Pangaea will help the start-up establish its first commercial waste-to-fuel factory, with the airline group set to become a customer.

The size of the investment was not disclosed, though Nova Pangaea’s chief executive Sarah Ellerby called it “transformational”.

IAG’s backing comes as it races to meet a goal of fuelling 10pc of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

The Government has set a goal of decarbonising Britain’s airline industry by 2050 under its “Jet Zero” plan. SAF is seen as the fastest option for transition, with current planes able to run on the fuel.

Luis Gallego, the airline group’s chief executive, said: “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the only realistic option for long haul airlines to decarbonise, which is why investment in this area is so critical.

“We are not just buying SAF, we are willing to invest in developing the industry, but we need governments in the UK and Europe to act now to encourage further investment.”

Nova Pangaea announced in November last year that it would build its headquarters and first commercial plant at Wilton International, an industrial site within Britain’s largest freeport at Teesside.

Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen told The Telegraph that IAG’s investment marked a “huge coup for Teesside, bringing more of the cleaner, safer and healthier jobs of the future”.

He added: “Decarbonisation is one of the biggest issues facing the aviation industry today. If we’re truly serious about becoming the UK’s clean energy powerhouse and growing Teesside Airport responsibly, SAF is an opportunity that we need to grab with both hands.”

IAG’s investment in the area is a boost for the under-fire mayor who is facing allegations of sweetheart deals with two local businessmen at Teesworks, a 4,500-acre brownfield development that forms part of the freeport zone.

Michael Gove, the Levelling Up Secretary, has ordered an inquiry into the claims. Mr Houchen and others accused have all denied any impropriety and branded it a Labour “smear campaign”

However, the furore has threatened to overshadow plans to revitalise a region and has already prompted companies to rethink plans to build factories at Teesworks.

The claims do not relate to the Wilton International industrial site where Nova Pangaea Technologies will be based.

Ms Ellerby said: “Our facility will be the UK’s first commercial plant of its kind, and it will play a crucial role in decarbonising the aviation sector, as well as providing local employment opportunities.

“We are confident of beginning construction later this year and producing second-generation biofuels by 2025.”
