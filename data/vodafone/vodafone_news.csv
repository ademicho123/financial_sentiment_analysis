FTSE 100 shares: 1 I�d buy today and 1 I wouldn�t touch with a bargepole,"A number of FTSE 100 shares have had an awesome run in 2024 so far. The index has reached record highs in the past couple of months. Even so, I think plenty of stocks still look like savvy buys.
That said, while I like the look of a number of Footsie constituents, not all take my fancy. If I had the cash, here�s one I�d buy today and one I�d avoid.

An AI play
Let�s start with a stock I�m eyeing: London Stock Exchange Group (LSE: LSEG). It�s up 3.6% this year, slightly less than the FTSE 100 (5.9%). But zooming out, the financial markets data stalwart is up 14.1% over the last year and 64.7% in the last five.
I like the stock due to its strong market position. It provides data to 99 of the top 100 global banks.
But there�s actually another reason why I want to add it to my portfolio. It recently announced a 10-year partnership with Microsoft, which will see artificial intelligence (AI) play a larger role in the products and services it provides.
As part of the deal, Microsoft took a 4% equity stake in the business. The move is �expected to increase LSEG�s revenue growth meaningfully over time as new products come on-stream�.
The stock does looks expensive. It�s trading higher than the FTSE 100 average. The financial data sector can also be highly competitive, which is another risk.
But as a long term buy-and-hold, I�m bullish on the stock, especially if it continues to expand further into the AI sector.
What�s more, while on the surface it may not look like your typical income stock, with its payout having grown at an annual compound growth rate of 14.6% during the last decade, there�s certainly potential for its 1.2% dividend yield to keep rising.

A value trap
One stock I plan to avoid like the plague is Vodafone (LSE: VOD). The stock is up a mere 0.2% year to date. It�s down 2.7% over the last year. But the telecoms giant has lost 45.9% of its value in the last five years.
At 59.9p, its shares may now look like a steal. And with it making some progress with its turnaround strategy, investors may be tempted to dive in.

The business continues to streamline after offloading its Spanish and Italian businesses for �5bn and �8bn, respectively. It also has plenty of potential for growth in exciting regions like Africa.
But there are a few reasons why I�m steering clear. Firstly, it has an alarming amount of debt (�33.2bn) on its balance sheet.
Secondly, its 10.9% yield looks tempting but is set to be cut in half next year from 9 cents a share to 4.5 cents. Its current payout is unsustainable. Its new yield will still be above the FTSE 100 average. Yet there�s always the risk it could be cut again further down the line.
With its poor share price performance over the last five years, I�m wary the stock could be a value trap. For that reason, I wouldn�t buy it today.

Creditors Fight Back Against Asset Stripping in New Bond Sales,"In the past week alone, two junk borrowers � Italian luxury supplier Rino Mastrotto and Vodafone Spain � have included stricter provisions in documentation for new bonds that restrict their ability to move assets out of reach of creditors. Clauses in both cases were focused on payments to so-called �unrestricted subsidiaries,� or entities that are not bound by the covenants of a debt agreement.
The provisions � both novelties in the European leveraged finance space � come in response to investor fears of losing access to collateral after a series of troubled European companies unleashed creditor-unfriendly moves to shore up their finances, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke to Bloomberg on the condition of anonymity.
Shifting assets into unrestricted subsidiaries has become increasingly common as borrowers look to exploit loose debt documentation. Once the assets are moved outside the restricted group, they can be used as collateral to raise more funds. Meanwhile, existing creditors see the value of their own collateral shrink.
In response to a request for comment about the bond documents, Rino Mastrotto Chief Executive Officer Matteo Mastrotto said that investors� interest in the deal �confirms the strength of our business model.� A spokesperson for Zegona, which owns Vodafone Spain, didn�t immediately respond to a similar request.

Altice Ordeal
In May, struggling French telecommunications group Altice France spooked creditors when it designated a series of subsidiaries as unrestricted, Bloomberg reported. Traders and investors were left scrambling to figure out what assets � if any � were held by the new unrestricted units.
The move prompted creditors to renew calls for legal protections that largely got written out of junk-bond deals when interest rates were at historic lows. Until now, efforts had largely focused on adding so-called J Crew blockers to new deals. Such clauses aim to prohibit the transfer of intellectual property away from the legal claims of existing lenders.
But since the Altice ordeal, investors have been looking into ways to shore up their protections even further.
Vodafone Spain added a more robust version of a J Crew blocker to its �1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) leveraged loan, with a clause that prevents the transfer of �material assets� to unrestricted subsidiaries. The company sold the debt to raise money for its buyout by Zegona Communications and used the blocker to make the deal more attractive during the syndication process. The company also limited its ability to make equity distributions to unrestricted subsidiaries.
Rino Mastrotto went even further, placing a cap on payments to unrestricted subsidiaries for its �320 million of floating-rate notes, according to an offering memorandum seen by Bloomberg News. The clause states that investments in unrestricted subsidiaries cannot be bigger than �15 million or 20% of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
The proceeds of the debt raise will be used to repay existing liabilities and to fund a �124 million dividend to shareholders, the offering memorandum said. The provision was discussed and later integrated into the deal following a period of pre-marketing with selected investors, according to a person familiar with the matter.

"Ericsson (ERIC), Vodafone Team Up to Deploy 5G Antenna in Germany","Ericsson ERIC recently announced that Vodafone has opted to deploy Ericsson�s Interleaved AIR 3218 antenna solution to expand 5G coverage in Germany. With the first antenna system already deployed at a multi-story car park in Dusseldorf, ERIC aims to install more than 500 systems across the country by the end of 2026.
Germany is witnessing an increase in data traffic of more than 30% annually. By integrating Ericsson�s innovative solution, Vodafone is aiming to accommodate this growing data demand. However, the company is facing challenges in finding suitable locations for antenna installations due to limited rooftop space. Moreover, the available ones do not match the static criteria of network planners.
Antennas mounted on rooftops are exposed to wind forces which put pressure on their surfaces. As more mobile phone antennas are installed, the increased number will amplify the wind load and consequently raise the pressure exerted on the surface. Many of the rooftop lacks structural integrity and wind resistance capability and hence cannot be upgraded with active 5G antennas.
Ericsson�s new compact antenna solution effectively addresses these issues. In Ericsson�s design, the active antenna is installed behind the passive antenna, reducing the overall space required on the mast or rooftop. Antenna-integrated radio and multiband passive antenna technology are nested together in one solution, minimizing the physical footprint. This ensures the expansion of 5G network capacity and coverage without any additional site footprint.
The Interleaved AIR 3218 is a great solution for highly congested urban areas where 5G deployment is affected by building regulations, planning laws and structural issues. The solution supports high data rates of more than one gigabit per second and can cover a radius of up to one kilometer, ensuring effective 5G coverage in city centers. The compact active-passive design simplifies the site upgradation process. The solutions support frequencies through the low and mid-band range, boost capacity and deliver premium service to end users.
Along with addressing the technical challenges of 5G expansion in urban areas, the solution also focuses on improving the operational efficiency of service providers. These factors will likely contribute positively in Ericsson�s commercial prospect and boost its competitive edge in the wireless equipment industry.
The stock has gained 16.7% over the past year compared with the industry�s growth of 47.5%.

"Vodafone (VOD), Meta Team Up to Enhance Network Efficiency","Vodafone Group Public Limited Company VOD recently announced that it has joined forces with Meta Platforms META to optimize the delivery of short-form videos and ensure efficient utilization of existing network infrastructure. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube are witnessing a rapid increase in video consumption, leading to significant growth in data usage on mobile networks. Per Ericsson's 2024 Mobility Report, global data traffic rose 25% in the 12 months leading up to the first quarter of 2024, with video making up 73% of all mobile traffic by the end of 2023.
This relentless growth in data usage puts considerable strain on network infrastructure. Telecom operators have to bear hefty costs to upgrade networks and accommodate the surging data traffic. Telecom companies argue that as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the network upgrade, the big tech companies should contribute to the expenses. Aligned with this concept, prominent telecom operators, including Orange, Telecom Italia and Telefonica earlier proposed that Google, Netflix, Meta and Amazon should shoulder a portion of 5G rollout costs.
To address these challenges, Meta has made improvements to its video engineering and infrastructure deployment systems for more efficient video delivery. Vodafone has successfully freed up network capacity at key 4G and 5G sites in high-traffic areas like shopping centers and transport hubs. Implementing these optimizations across Vodafone's has boosted network efficiency in its European without compromising the viewing experience.
5G subscription currently stands at 15% of total subscriptions in Europe, and the figure is projected to climb to 53% by 2028. This significant 5G growth presents both opportunities and challenges for telecom operators. Vodafone�s partnership with Meta is likely to pave the way for other operators to adopt proactive measures in managing network congestion and enhancing service quality.
The stock has lost 0.3% over the past year compared with the industry�s decline of 9.9%.

Vodafone breaks network data records at Glastonbury,"Vodafone says it broke network data records during Glastonbury this year, with festivalgoers using 33% more data than during the event in 2023.
The mobile operator, which is the official connectivity partner of Glastonbury, said more than 225 terabytes of data were used over the course of the five-day festival, which was headlined by Dua Lipa, Coldplay and Sza � the equivalent of 7,300 hours of HD video streaming.
Vodafone said 258 gigabytes of data were uploaded during Coldplay�s headline slot on the Saturday night, the equivalent of 74,000 high-resolution pictures being uploaded to Instagram.
To handle the crowds of over 200,000 at Worthy Farm in Somerset, Vodafone installed 10 temporary masts around the site.
In addition, the operator offered festivalgoers the chance to test out its own network during their time at the festival by allowing them to temporarily switch to Vodafone via eSim and without changing their number � a offer the firm said nearly 15,000 people tried out.
The official Glastonbury app was also supported by the mobile operator, who said it was downloaded more than 226,000 times, including by around one in 10 who were not at the festival itself.
Elsewhere, Vodafone said just under 10,000 people bought power banks for charging their devices from the firm�s on-site Connect & Charge tent.
The operator said that for each one of these purchases, it would donate free connectivity to charities in the local area, as part of a scheme to help Glastonbury attendees give back to the local community.
Rob Winterschladen, Vodafone UK consumer director, said: �As official connectivity partner for Glastonbury Festival, I�m incredibly proud that we boosted our network to its highest capacity ever, allowed all festivalgoers the opportunity to try The Nation�s Network for free, and delivered a game-changing app.
�I look forward to delivering even more for fans and customers across the summer and beyond.�

Vodafone and Meta scheme cuts mobile network traffic and boosts video quality,"Mobile phone users can view more high-quality short-form videos as a result of a new technological collaboration between Vodafone and Facebook parent company Meta.
The two firms said they have worked together to free up network capacity for mobile users � testing it in 11 regions in Europe � to cut network traffic and enable more people to watch better-quality videos.
Vodafone said it had freed up network space at popular 4G and 5G sites in busy locations, such as shopping centres and transport hubs, while Meta said it had made improvements to its video engineering and infrastructure deployment systems, resulting in better optimisation and efficiency.
The two companies said they had conducted an initial three-week test in the UK in April, and were now open to working with other firms to expand the use of the technology, saying it would help keep critical networks free of congestion and save energy.
Meta also owns Instagram, which is known for its short-form videos as well as image-based posts.
Alberto Ripepi, chief network officer at Vodafone, said: �Meta�s willingness to optimise the delivery of video for its applications leads the way for a more efficient use of existing network resources.
�Vodafone and Meta have implemented these optimisations across Vodafone�s European markets and intend to continue collaborating to foster additional efficiencies.�
Meta vice president of network engineering Gaya Nagarajan said: �Our relationship with Vodafone is a long-term partnership, and collaboration on video optimisation is an opportunity to drive innovation and shape the future of the internet.
�We are committed to continuing our collaboration with innovative partners like Vodafone, device manufacturers, equipment vendors and the wider digital ecosystem, to push the boundaries of video optimisation.�

Meta and Vodafone optimise video to boost network efficiency,"LONDON (Reuters) - Instagram-owner Meta has worked with Vodafone to free up capacity on 11 of its European mobile networks by optimising the delivery of short-form video without noticeably compromising the viewing experience.
Demand for video on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube is driving relentless growth in data usage on mobile networks.
Global traffic grew 25% in the 12 months to the first quarter of 2024, according to Ericsson's 2024 Mobility Report, and video accounted for 73% of all mobile traffic by the end of 2023.
Telecom operators including Vodafone have complained that they have to shoulder the cost of upgrading networks while the Big Tech companies that benefit get a free ride.
An EU push to make Big Tech contribute to 5G investment stalled last year, and there is no chance it will be revived before the end of the year, if it is at all.
Vodafone said partnering with platforms like Meta was a ""pragmatic way"" to address the debate around fair share.
""Meta's willingness to optimise the delivery of video for its applications leads the way for a more efficient use of existing network resources,"" said Alberto Ripepi, Vodafone's chief network officer.

""Vodafone and Meta have implemented these optimisations across Vodafone's European markets and intend to continue collaborating to foster additional efficiencies.""
Vodafone said the optimisation resulted in a low double-digit reduction in Meta's data traffic on its British network during a trial in April, freeing up capacity in busy locations like shopping centres and transport hubs.
Meta's vice president of network engineering Gaya Nagarajan said the company was committed to working with innovative partners like Vodafone, device manufacturers, equipment vendors and the wider digital ecosystem to push the boundaries of video optimisation.
Spain's Telefonica said last week it was also working with Meta on optimising video traffic delivery on its networks.

"How to target a �60,000 second income with a brand-new investment portfolio","Earning a second income in the stock market�s fairly straightforward. Investors can simply focus on buying and holding dividend-paying enterprises and then watch the money steadily roll in. However, when starting from scratch, the process can be a bit daunting. And simply chasing the highest yields can result in some shockingly bad returns.
So with that in mind, let�s explore some best practices for income investing and how to aim for a �60k long-term portfolio income stream.

Compounding dividends
Across the UK, the average household is able to save roughly �450 a month. Suppose that money is allocated to a FTSE 100 index fund today. In this scenario, investors can expect to earn between 6% and 8% a year moving forward, based on the historical performance of the UK�s flagship index.
Around half of these gains stem from dividends. And at a 4% yield, each �450 monthly investment would unlock roughly �18 of annual passive income. Needless to say, that�s not exactly a life-changing sum. But that quickly changes once compounding enters the picture.
Instead of immediately withdrawing dividends, investors can automatically reinvest them. And with more capital being injected into the wealth-building process, an impressive sum can accumulate over time. In fact, after 30 years of earning 8% total returns, an investor could end up with a �670,660 portfolio generating roughly �26,830 in passive income.

Earning �60,000
Having an extra 26 grand in the bank each year is certainly nothing to scoff at. But by being shrewd and taking on a bit more risk, it�s possible to more than double this second income.
Instead of mimicking market returns with an index fund, investors can take their income portfolio into their own hands. The London Stock Exchange is filled with dividend shares offering yields significantly higher than 4%.
Suppose a portfolio of these enterprises delivers a 6% yield while still delivering another 4% in capital gains? In that case, after 30 years of �450 monthly deposits, a portfolio would reach into the seven-figure territory, generating �60,000 of dividends each year.

Taking a step back
Earning almost twice the average national salary without having to lift a finger is an undeniably awesome prospect. But it�s important to realise that none of it is guaranteed. Let�s take a look at Vodafone (LSE:VOD) as an example.
A few months ago, the telecommunications giant was offering a staggering 11% dividend yield. But anyone who was lured into this income prospect is likely kicking themselves right now, given that dividends have been slashed in half.
With the cost of debt rising considerably, Vodafone�s balance sheet is under a lot of pressure right now. Management has been busy cutting costs, selling off underperforming segments, and changing the dividend policy to try and fix the foundations of the business.
To its credit, Vodafone�s financial position is on the mend. But the outlook for dividends remains bleak. And another payout cut could be on the horizon if performance in Germany continues to deteriorate.
This goes to show that when hunting for higher-yielding income opportunities, particular attention needs to be paid to the quality of the underlying business. A weak balance sheet and constricted cash flows are just two of the potential red flags that can lead investors astray.

Which is better value? The Vodafone or Lloyds share price?,"As I own both stocks, I�d like to say that determining whether the Vodafone (LSE:VOD) or Lloyds (LSE:LLOY) share price offers the better value is similar to deciding which of your children you like best. Unfortunately, their lacklustre share price performance means I�ve come to hate them both.
Okay, �hate� might be a little strong but I�ve become increasingly frustrated with their long-term underperformance relative to, for example, the FTSE 100.
However, I�m going to try and identify which one I think�s more of a bargain.

Asset-based valuation
Using the price-to-book (PTB) ratio, the telecoms giant appears to be the cheapest. At 31 March, Vodafone had a PTB ratio of 0.36, compared to 0.73 for Lloyds.
This means if all of the assets on Vodafone�s balance sheet were sold for their accounting value � and the proceeds used to repay its liabilities � there would be 192p a share left over to return to shareholders.

Profitability
The position is reversed when looking at profits. For the year ending 31 December (FY24), Lloyds is expected to record earnings per share (EPS) of 6.2p. This gives a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.35. For FY25 and FY26, the forward earnings multiple is 7.73 and 6.37 respectively.
Analysts are forecasting Vodafone�s EPS to be 6.85p for the year ending March 2025 (FY25). With a current share price of around 70p, this means the current year P/E ratio is 10.2.
EPS is expected to increase to 8.38 and 9.01p, in FY26 and FY27 respectively. This implies a forward P/E ratio range of 8.35-7.77.

Dividends
When it comes to dividend yield, there�s not much to choose between the two. Vodafone suffers from its recent 50% cut. An anticipated payout of 4.5 euro cents (3.81p) implies a yield of 5.4%. Although still impressive, it was in double digits a few months ago.
Lloyds is expected to return 3p a share in FY24 � 8.7% more than it did in FY23. This gives the banking stock a yield of 5.1%.
And the winner is �
These types of valuation measures are intended to facilitate the comparison of stocks across sectors. However, we�ve seen that Vodafone wins when it comes to its balance sheet, Lloyds is ahead using earnings and both offer similar dividend yields.
However, if I had to choose I�d pick Vodafone over Lloyds. The telecoms giant�s currently restructuring its operations which, once concluded, will see it emerge as a more streamlined group.
I think it will take a while before it grows again but it�s more of an international business. This means it�s less reliant on one market.
Although a turnaround isn�t guaranteed, I�m confident that its decision to sell its less profitable divisions is a good one.
By contrast, Lloyds is more focused on the UK economy. Although the domestic economy�s forecast to grow over the next couple of years, a recovery is far from certain. The public finances don�t appear to be in good shape which might restrict growth.
And its share price is only around 3.5% below its 52-week low. I therefore feel that Vodafone shares currently offer better value.

3 dividend shares I�m avoiding in today�s stock market,"Dividend shares can be a great source of passive income, but investors need to think carefully about which ones to buy. Mistakes in this area can be expensive.
Over the long term, the best results come from buying shares in quality businesses at attractive prices. But not every company fits the bill in this regard.

National Grid
A lot of income investors love National Grid (LSE:NG) shares and it�s easy to see why. The company�s basically a monopoly in an important industry and this is unlikely to change.
Surprisingly, this doesn�t make it a good investment though. Protection from competitors comes at the cost of regulation and this amounts to a significant potential threat.
Over in the US, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has highlighted the risk of regulators preventing utilities companies from earning a good return. And UK investors would be unwise to ignore this.
This actually means National Grid could find its profits limited by forces beyond its control. That�s not something I look for in a stock to buy, so I�m leaving this one to others.

Legal & General
Legal & General (LSE:LGEN) shares have an eye-catching dividend yield of 8.7%. But investors should think about why it�s so high � and why the stock�s down 15% since 2019.
One reason is the business is fundamentally risky. Life insurance contracts are long and pricing them involves trying to assess risks that could be decades in the future.
If things go wrong, the magnitude of the losses can be huge. And it isn�t clear to me that Legal & General has a clear competitive advantage when it comes to pricing policies.
The company has a good record when it comes to dividends and it could certainly turn out well. But I can see a lot of danger that comes with reaching for that big 8.7% yield.

Vodafone
There�s actually quite a lot to like about Vodafone (LSE:VOD) shares at the moment. The stock�s down 48% over the last five years, but there are signs the future could be brighter.
The company�s biggest problem has been the industry it operates in. Excessive competition in a capital-intensive business has resulted in poor returns for shareholders.
Vodafone has a plan to turn things around though. This involves merging with Three in the UK to generate meaningful scale and maximise existing markets where it has no advantage.
This could turn out to be a very good strategy. But nothing�s guaranteed and while some might be attracted to a risky turnaround, I prefer less speculative investments.

Dividend investing
At the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the hero tries to identify the Holy Grail from a series of cups. But there�s a catch � the true Grail gives life, a false one takes it away.
It�s the same with dividend stocks. The good ones can provide passive income for decades, but bad ones can prove to be expensive mistakes.
That�s not a reason to avoid buying dividend stocks entirely. But it�s a reason to be selective in working out which ones are worth investing in.

1 stock I�d avoid like the plague in today�s stock market,"The UK stock market has had a terrific run in 2024 so far. While things have cooled off on the back of the General Election, the FTSE 100 is still up by 8.5% since the start of the year including dividends. That�s obviously a welcome sign, given the lacklustre performance delivered since inflation reared its ugly head in late 2021. Yet sadly, not all of Britain�s leading businesses have been so fortunate.
Shares of Vodafone (LSE:VOD) seem to have been left behind, growing by a measly 1% over the same period. By comparison, one of its chief competitors, BT Group, is up almost 13%. Like many companies with highly leveraged balance sheets, Vodafone appears to be struggling under its own weight. And it�s why I�m not planning on adding the shares to my portfolio any time soon. But is there hope for the long run?

What�s going on with Vodafone shares?
Just like BT, Vodafone is a company that was mismanaged for years with numerous failed turnaround attempts under its belt. In 2023, the business once again brought in a new CEO, Margherita Della Valle, to try and right the ship. And to her credit, Della Valle has made progress.
An organisational restructuring has seen the telecoms giant�s Spanish and Italian segments getting sold off. And just last month, the firm sold 485m shares of its investment in Indus Towers Limited to raise another �1.7bn.
Management�s strategy revolves around improving the balance sheet while refocusing the business on the UK, Germany, and Africa. The latter region is particularly exciting given its M-Pesa digital payments platform adoption is spreading like wildfire. As such, this region now generates a fifth of the firm�s top-line revenue.
Meanwhile, with the economic conditions in the UK improving, growth (albeit modest) has also made a comeback. But if that�s the case, why has the Vodafone share price continued to limp on while the rest of the stock market surged? The answer appears to lie in Germany.

Underperformance in Europe
Inflation has been problematic for businesses worldwide. However, for telecoms companies, inflationary operating expenses are typically quickly passed on to customers. Unfortunately, in Germany, Vodafone appears to be struggling on that front.
Its latest results saw revenue coming in flat, underperforming the country�s inflation rate. At the same time, higher energy costs and employee salaries have dragged margins down. It seems customers are starting to switch to cheaper alternative providers in Vodafone�s primary market. Needless to say, that�s quite a big problem.

A chance for a comeback?
Offering cheaper deals in Germany could be one viable strategy to recapture lost market share. However, in order to afford such a move, the firm�s debt burden needs to come down significantly.
To management�s credit, progress has been made on this front, with total debt & equivalents falling from �65bn to �57bn between September 2023 and March 2024. However, that�s still a massive liability to contend with. And investors are already feeling the pressure, given that dividends have just been cut in half to prioritise debt reduction.
Providing the strategy continues to deliver significant debt reduction in the coming years, Vodafone may be able to bounce back stronger than before, along with dividends. However, this task is hardly simple. And with other companies to pick from, Vodafone isn�t a stock I�m eager to start buying right now.

Vodafone (VOD) Extends Network Partnership Amid Merger Scrutiny,"Vodafone Group Public Limited Company VOD recently announced an extension of the existing mobile network sharing agreement with Virgin Media O2 until the mid-2030s. The deal aims to improve network coverage for both their customers throughout the U.K. Per the recently inked agreement, if Vodafone's proposed merger with Three UK receives regulatory approval, the enlarged entity will sell a portion of premium 5G spectrum to Virgin Media O2, which currently holds the lowest share.
Vodafone and Hutchison's Three UK are two of the major network operators in the U.K., alongside EE and O2. Vodafone UK and Three struck a merger deal that will create U.K�s largest mobile network operators with 27 million clients. Vodafone is set to have a majority stake in the combined entity.
The proposed merger is under thorough scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Completion of the merger would reduce the number of mobile network operators in Britain to three from four. While this move could mean lower costs and higher profits for the companies involved, consumers might be hit by higher prices and reduced service quality. Additionally, the adverse impact on smaller players in the market is also a matter of concern for the regulators.
Vodafone's new agreement with Virgin Media O2 aims to address these regulatory concerns. Vodafone management emphasized that the proposed merger, together with the new agreement, will create a more balanced spectrum distribution and foster a competitive market structure in the country by establishing a strong third player. Vodafone expects the recent agreement with Virgin Media O2 will alleviate concerns and enable it to gain merger approval from CMA.
The stock has lost 3.1% over the past year compared with the industry�s decline of 10.8%.

Vodafone currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, is likely to benefit from strong momentum and diversification across its top verticals and product lines. The company has a software-driven, data-centric approach to help customers build their cloud architecture and enhance their cloud experience. Arista has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 16.07% and delivered an earnings surprise of 15.39%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. You can see the complete list of today�s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It holds a leadership position in 100-gigabit Ethernet switching share in port for the high-speed datacenter segment. Arista is increasingly gaining market traction in 200 and 400-gig high-performance switching products and remains well-positioned for healthy growth in data-driven cloud networking business with proactive platforms and predictive operations.

Will the Vodafone share price ever reach �1 again?,"The Vodafone (LSE:VOD) share price continues to disappoint. It appears to be stuck in a range of 65-75p. Shareholders (like me) could be forgiven for thinking that the days when the shares were worth more than �1 are long gone.
Looking back to July 2023, its shares have fallen 7% in value. Since July 2019, they�ve crashed 48%. It�s sometimes hard to believe that Vodafone was once the UK�s most valuable listed company.
It�s a different story with Deutsche Telekom, Europe�s largest telecoms operator. Over the past five years, its share price has risen by over 50%.
Both companies like to use EBITDAaL (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, after leases) to measure profitability.
Vodafone recently sold its business in Spain and is currently in advanced talks to dispose of its Italian division. Excluding these, analysts are expecting EBITDAaL, for the year ending 31 March 2025 (FY25), to be �10.9bn (�9.3bn at current exchange rates).
Deutsche Telekom is forecast to generate earnings of �42.8bn (�36.3bn) in 2024.

If these figures prove to be correct, it means the two companies are currently valued at 2 and 2.73 times their expected current year earnings respectively.
If Vodafone could achieve a valuation similar to that of its larger rival, its share price would be just below 100p � 95p, in fact.

Delving into the detail
A closer look at the recent financial performance of the two companies highlights why, in my opinion, they�re valued differently.
The biggest single market for both is Germany. The first three months of 2024 saw Deutsche Telekom record its 30th successive quarterly earnings growth in the country. It�s also managed to grow its profits for 25 consecutive quarters in Europe as a whole.
By contrast, Vodafone�s revenue, margin and adjusted EBITDAaL in Germany were all lower in FY24, compared to FY23.
It�s a similar story with net debt. At 31 March it was 3.02 times profits for the UK company. At 31 December 2023, Deutsche Telekom�s ratio was 2.58.

Ringing the changes
Despite this apparently gloomy assessment, I�m pleased to report that Vodafone is seeking to address its problems. That�s why it wants to get rid of its Mediterranean businesses. These are dragging down its return on capital (this measure should improve by one percentage point post-disposal) and will give it up to �13bn in sales proceeds.
In an attempt to soften the blow of a 50% dividend cut, �4bn of this is expected to be used to buy the company�s own shares. The balance will help to reduce its borrowings.
The company has also raised its prices in Germany. And it intends to focus more on the business sector in Europe.
In addition, plans are being made to simplify the group�s operating structure to improve its customer experience. And if regulatory approval�s obtained, its UK operation will be merged with Three.
Deutsche Telekom shows that it�s possible to be successful in the telecoms industry despite the triple threat of intense competition, huge capital expenditure requirements, and regulatory oversight.
I therefore remain hopeful that Vodafone will be able to turn its business round and start growing again. However, in my opinion, only when evidence of this becomes clearer will it be possible to justify a three-figure share price again.

"Trending tickers: SoftBank, Reddit, Vodafone, GSK","SoftBank shares rose 1.5% overnight to a record all-time high as it ramps up investments in artificial intelligence and semiconductors.
The Japanese tech firm is gaining investor attention as its telecom arm moves aggressively towards generative AI, tying up with Microsoft and start-up Perplexity AI Inc. It is also building data centres stocked with Nvidia accelerators.
Its chip unit Arm Holdings is also trying to position its architecture as a means to conserve energy in devices running AI.
Tomoaki Kawasaki, a senior analyst at Iwaicosmo Securities, said: �It�s getting another boost as more investors see it as a semiconductor-related stock.""
Last month, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told shareholders that investments the technology group had made in the past were �just a warm-up� for his grand ambition to create an era of artificial intelligence.

Reddit found favour with investors last night, with the San Francisco-based company surging 10%.

It comes as usage for Reddit search has boomed. According to data from Similarweb, the social media platform saw a 39% increase in website visits, year-over-year, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL) reported a drop of 2.2%.

Meanwhile in May, the firm revealed it had struck a partnership deal with artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI.

Under the agreement, the company behind the ChatGPT chatbot will get access to Reddit content, while it will also bring AI-powered features to the social media platform.

Shares were slightly lower in pre-market trading on Wednesday.

Vodafone struck a fresh network sharing agreement with Virgin Media O2 on Wednesday, boosting hopes of winning approval for its merger deal with Three.
The operators have agreed to extend a partnership that was due to expire in 2025, while Virgin Media O2 will acquire more spectrum to better align spectrum holding between different operators in anticipation of the takeover being waived through.

The acquisition is conditional upon the merger being completed.

Vodafone�s planned merger with Three is currently under investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The UK competition regulator will reach a decision expected before the end of the year.

Lutz Sch�ler, chief executive of Virgin Media O2 said: �This new agreement with Vodafone ensures that quality mobile network choice, performance, coverage and competition is enhanced to the benefit of millions of consumers, businesses and our mobile operator partners across the country.

�We are extending and bolstering elements of our existing network-sharing arrangement, while also ensuring there is a robust, balanced and functional structure in place for the long-term should Vodafone and Three�s proposed merger gain consent.

�We believe that this new agreement addresses the issues we have voiced and the CMA outlined in its initial decision, and will now continue our engagement with the regulator in this spirit.�
GSK has bought the full rights to develop, make and sell COVID and influenza vaccines from Germany's CureVac

The UK�s second-biggest drugmaker is paying �400m (�339, $430) upfront and up to an additional �1.05bn to the biotech firm, which was founded in T�bingen in southwest Germany in 2000.

The two companies have restructured their existing collaboration into a new licensing agreement.

Since 2020, GSK and CureVac have worked together to develop mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases. GSK will now take control of CureVac's leading experimental vaccines to fight infections, including seasonal flu and bird flu.
They currently have vaccine candidates for seasonal influenza and Covid-19 in intermediate clinical trials (phase II) and avian influenza in phase I clinical development. The jabs are based on CureVac�s mRNA technology.

Tony Wood, GSK�s chief scientific officer, said: ""We are excited about our flu/Covid-19 programmes and the opportunity to develop best-in-class mRNA vaccines to change the standard of care. With this new agreement, we will apply GSK�s capabilities, partnerships and intellectual property to CureVac�s technology, to deliver these promising vaccines at pace.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 announce new network-sharing deal,"Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 have agreed to extend their existing mobile network-sharing agreement, and will extend it further should Vodafone�s proposed merger with Three UK go ahead.

A final decision on the proposed merger between Vodafone and Three is currently being considered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 said the core of the deal was that they had agreed to extend their existing network-sharing arrangement of more than a decade, saying it helped bolster mobile coverage for customers across the country.

But the two network operators also confirmed that should the Vodafone-Three merger be approved, Virgin Media would then acquire spectrum from the newly created merged companies to establish three scaled mobile network operators with a more balanced range of spectrum held by each.

The companies argue this would benefit both consumers and businesses across the country by enhancing choice, quality and network coverage.

Concerns raised around the Vodafone-Three merger include fears that it could reduce competition by cutting the number of major network operators in the UK.

Ahmed Essam, chief executive of European markets for Vodafone, said: �With this agreement and our merger with Three, we will transform the mobile experience for over 50 million customers in the UK for the long-term, providing significant network improvements including more choice, better quality and greater coverage across the country.

�These benefits extend to both retail and wholesale mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) customers.

�The proposed merger, together with this agreement, will boost competition by establishing a strong third player in the UK mobile market and will improve the balance of spectrum holdings, levelling the playing field between the UK�s mobile operators.�

Lutz Schuler, chief executive of Virgin Media O2, said: �This new agreement with Vodafone ensures that quality mobile network choice, performance, coverage and competition is enhanced to the benefit of millions of consumers, businesses and our mobile operator partners across the country.

�We are extending and bolstering elements of our existing network-sharing arrangement, while also ensuring there is a robust, balanced and functional structure in place for the long-term should Vodafone and Three�s proposed merger gain consent.

The Vodafone share price is down nearly 50%. Is it a sleeping giant or one to avoid?,"The last five years have been underwhelming for Vodafone (LSE: VOD). During that time, its share price has fallen by 48.8%.

On the flip side, the FTSE 100 has climbed 7.5%. Vodafone was once the largest company in Europe by market capitalisation. Today, it�s far from it.

But I love a bargain. And I love buying high-quality companies. So, could now be the time to consider buying the telecommunications stalwart?

A turnaround?
Vodafone stock has been on a steady decline in the last half-decade. Back then, I would have shelled out 134.6p for a share. At times, the stock reached as high as 162.2p. Today, a share costs 69.2p. Clearly, it�s crying out for a turnaround. But what could spark that?

Well, one factor is the streamlining process it�s undergoing. It has exited unprofitable regions such as Spain and Italy, selling off its businesses in these countries for �5bn and �8bn, respectively.

The company is also turning its attention to its German market, where it sees a large potential for growth. In its latest results, it said it expected an �acceleration of our underlying growth rates� in Germany this year.

Under CEO Margherita Della Valle, we�re starting to see signs of recovery for Vodafone. With some of the cash it has generated in recent times, the firm has announced a fresh buyback scheme. Shareholders will be pleased to see that.

Debt issues
Yet, while there�s no denying it has made decent progress with its plans, I see a couple of issues that could hamstring the business.

To begin, it has a thumping pile of debt on its balance sheet. It has �33.2bn in net debt. That�s around one and a half times its market capitalisation. The debt-to-equity ratio of around 80% is concerning.

There�s also its dividend yield to consider. Its 11.1% payout is one of its star features. That�s the highest on the FTSE 100. But there�s a caveat.

That will be cut in half from next year, meaning its yield will be closer to the 5.5% mark. That�s still above the Footsie average of 3.6%.

It makes sense and is a smart move. Its current payout ratio is over 200%. That means more is being paid in dividends than earnings. Reducing its dividend will free up cash for the firm. Nonetheless, I think the stock loses a good chunk of its appeal with a smaller yield.

Time to buy?
So, is it time for me to buy the stock? I don�t think so.

Today, its shares trade on 18.3 times earnings and 13.8 times forward earnings. That�s above the Footsie average. I�m okay with paying a premium for companies that I deem worthy. With Vodafone, I don�t see that.

Its debt is a very big concern of mine and as an investor who targets income, its falling yield doesn�t help.

Of course, I could be proved wrong, and Vodafone could stage a comeback. Either way, it�s one I�ll be avoiding for now. The Footsie is full of bargains. I�ll be snapping those up before I consider Vodafone.

Vodafone agrees new Virgin Media O2 tie-up to ease competition concerns,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 have agreed to extend their network-sharing deal to the mid-2030s, including a spectrum shift that could help Vodafone to win regulatory approval for its tie-up with mobile operator Three.
The $19 billion merger between Vodafone's UK operation and Hutchison's Three UK is the subject of a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation.
Under the new network-sharing deal, an enlarged Vodafone-Three entity would sell some of its combined 59% of the best spectrum for 5G networks to Virgin Media O2, which has the lowest share.
That could help to address the regulator's concerns about a merger that would reduce the number of mobile networks in Britain to three from four.

""We believe that this new agreement addresses the issues we have voiced and the CMA outlined in its initial decision,"" said Lutz Schuler, CEO of Virgin Media O2.
Vodafone said the network-sharing deal would allow customers of Virgin Media O2 to benefit from the 11 billion pound ($14 billion) investment plan in 5G networks that it has pledged if the Three merger is approved.
""The proposed merger, together with this agreement, will boost competition by establishing a strong third player in the UK mobile market,"" said Ahmed Essam, Vodafone's CEO of European Markets.
Vodafone and Telefonica UK agreed a network-sharing deal in 2012 to accelerate the rollout of 4G. Vodafone later transferred its stake to its Vantage Towers spin-out while Virgin Media O2, owned by Telefonica and Liberty Global, sold part of its stake to GLIL Infrastructure last year.
Britain's other two networks - BT's EE and Three UK - set up their own network-sharing agreement in 2007. They agreed a less extensive deal last year that does not include joint infrastructure upgrades. It expires in 2031.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three to fall short on rural broadband coverage as deadline looms,"Three is set to fall short of rural coverage targets as a deadline for tackling so-called mobile signal �not spots� looms.
Mobile network operators have until July to expand their coverage to reach 88pc of the UK�s landmass in the first part of a �1bn government project.
Vodafone has said it will hit the deadline while it is understood Virgin Media O2 (VMO2) is also on track. Smaller rival Three said it was �working hard� to meet the targets but failed to confirm it would do so.
It comes after BT struck a rural coverage deal with some of its rivals to help meet the deadline.
The Telegraph has learned that BT, which owns the EE network, reached agreements with VMO2 and Vodafone to provide access to some of its mobile masts in remote locations.
EE, which has more mobile masts than its rivals and is contributing to the initial phase of the rural coverage project separately, reached its initial target earlier this year.
The last-minute deals underscore the rush to upgrade rural mobile signals after the Government rejected pleas for an 18-month extension.
Three could now be at risk of a fine if it fails to complete the first phase of the project, which is focused on �partial not spot� areas where at least one operator provides coverage but not all of them.

Ofcom has the power to fine companies up to 10pc of their global turnover, though officials have insisted that any response would be �reasonable�.

It is understood that Three will meet with Ofcom in the coming weeks.
Any delay to the project, known as the Shared Rural Network (SRN), would also deal a blow to local communities waiting for an upgrade to their critical telecoms infrastructure.
Analysis by consultancy FarrPoint, commissioned by EE, this week revealed that 4G connectivity had delivered economic benefits of up to �6.9m over 15 years for rural communities.
The second phase of the SRN project, which will be funded by the Government, will target �total not spot� areas, where no operators currently provide 4G services.

Ministers have set out a target of covering 95pc of the UK�s landmass by the end of next year and to the entire country by earlier 2027.

A spokesman for Three said: �We are working hard to meet the interim deadline and are on track to deliver the overall January 2027 target for 4G geographic coverage under the SRN programme.�

A BT spokesman said: �We�ve been in discussions with a number of other mobile networks in recent months to share sites to support their own coverage efforts and we�ll continue to collaborate with them on the next phase of the project.�

A spokesman for Ofcom said: �We�re responsible for assessing mobile network operators� compliance with their coverage obligations, and we expect to receive data about their progress soon.

�Over the summer we will carry out our own analysis, including tests where we�ll drive to certain locations to check that coverage has been delivered. An update on our findings and next steps will then be published in due course.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone Raises $1.8 Billion in Indus Towers Stake Sale,"(Bloomberg) -- Vodafone Group Plc subsidiaries have raised about $1.8 billion in proceeds by selling shares in India�s Indus Towers Ltd. The companies sold 484.7 million shares at 311.4 rupees each, according to terms of the deal obtained by Bloomberg News. The block deals, executed on local exchanges, represent a stake of about 18% in Indus Towers.

Chief Executive Officer Margherita Della Valle, who took the reigns last year, has sold off underperforming markets and worked to scale back a sprawling empire. Vodafone shares rose 0.8% to 71.20 pence in London trading at 8:29 a.m.

The British company increased the number of shares offered ahead of the sale by about 80%, according to the terms of the offering. The shares were sold near the bottom of a range of 310 rupees to 341 rupees.

The significant increase in offering shows �there is demand for Indian paper as well as liquidity available to absorb large sales,� said Sunil Shah, group CEO at Mumbai-based Khambatta Securities Ltd. With multiple large blocks successfully executed on Indian exchanges, it will be easier for investors to exit holdings, he added.

The Indus Towers block was the biggest of a series of block trades launched in the Indian market between Tuesday and Wednesday, as shareholders rushed to tap investors increasing exposure to India�s surging equities market.

Wireless carrier Bharti Airtel, which owns about 48% stake in Indus Towers, said it bought an additional 1% holding in the company via block trades.

The shares of Indus Towers slumped as much as 9.6% following the block trades but pared the decline to 4.2% on Wednesday in Mumbai. They are still up more than 65% this year, one of the best performers on BSE Ltd.�s gauge of telecom stocks.

Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley arranged the block sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK's Vodafone sells $1.8 billion stake in India's Indus Towers; Airtel boosts stake,"MUMBAI (Reuters) -Vodafone Group has sold a bigger-than-planned 18% stake in India's Indus Towers, raising $1.82 billion that will serve to reduce its debt, the British telecom group said on Wednesday.

Bharti Airtel, India's no. 2 telecom company, said it bought about 1% of Indus shares in the transaction, bringing its stake in the mobile tower operator to around 49%.

Vodafone, which owned 21.5% of Indus prior to the sale, had initially planned to sell a 10% stake but strong investor demand made it nearly double the sale size, according to a banking source familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the person was not authorised to speak to the media.

Vodafone said it sold 484.7 million Indus shares at 310-341 rupees per share, raising 153 billion rupees, or 1.7 billion euros, in gross proceeds that it will use to repay debt.

The group said it had bank borrowings of 1.8 billion euros against its Indian assets, which also include a stake in Vodafone Idea, the country's debt-saddled No.3 telecom operator by subscribers.

Indus shares closed down 3%, after sliding as much as 9.6% in its busiest session ever.

Besides Airtel, SBI Mutual Fund and Kotak Securities were also among buyers of Indus' shares, exchange data showed.

Vodafone Group now has a 3.1% stake in Indus. Vodafone Idea also has a stake in Indus. Private equity giant KKR and Canadian fund CPPIB sold their entire stakes in February.

Vodafone Group sold its stake via so-called block deals, where investors sell shares in the market. They have risen in popularity in India with the stock market trading at record-high levels.

Vodafone Idea shares ended 0.4% higher, while Bharti Airtel's shares closed down 2.5%. ($1 = 83.4300 Indian rupees)

"Vodafone to sell 10% stake in India's Indus Towers for up to $1.1 billion, term sheet shows","BENGALURU (Reuters) -Vodafone Group will sell about 10% stake in India's Indus Towers for as much as $1.1 billion on Wednesday, per a term sheet seen by Reuters, as a part of the British firm's efforts to repay debt.

Last week, Reuters reported that Vodafone was mulling to sell its stake in mobile-tower operator Indus Towers, in which it owns a 21.5% stake via various group entities.

Vodafone plans to repay part of its $42.17 billion net debt using proceeds from the Indus Towers stake sale, sources had told Reuters last week.

Vodafone will sell roughly 268 million shares in Indus Towers through stock market block deals in Mumbai at a price range of 310 rupees to 341 rupees per share, valuing the stake between $996 million to $1.1 billion, the term sheet showed on Tuesday.

The midpoint of the price range is at a 4.5% discount to Indus's stock closing price on Tuesday, but roughly in-line with its close on Friday after Reuters reported on the sale. Indian markets were closed on Monday.

Vodafone has hired Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Jefferies and BNP Paribas to manage the stake sale in Indian stock markets, the term sheet showed.

Vodafone and Indus Towers did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Block deals, where investors sell shares in stock markets, have become increasingly popular in India as the market has surged to record highs.

Vodafone (VOD) Considers Selling Tower Assets to Trim Debt Burden,"Per a Reuters report, Vodafone Group Public Limited Company VOD is mulling to divest its $2.3 billion stake in India's Indus Towers through stock market block deals next week. The strategic move is part of Vodafone�s broader effort to address its substantial debt load.

The British telecom giant holds a 21.5% stake in Indus Towers via various group entities. As of the most recent closing stock price in Mumbai, this investment is valued at approximately $2.3 billion. However, the exact size of the stake sale might be less than 21.5%, depending on market demand.

The transaction is crucial for Vodafone as it seeks to alleviate its massive $42.2 billion net debt.

The divestiture also aligns with Vodafone's 2022 announcement to sell its then-28% stake in Indus. However, progress has been slow, with only a small portion sold until now. Efforts to sell to rival telecom firms have not been fruitful, making stock market block deals a practical alternative.

Indus Towers, a major player in the global tower industry with around 220,000 towers, counts Bharti Airtel among its shareholders. From an industry perspective, block deals are gaining traction in India's bullish market, highlighted by British American Tobacco's recent $2 billion stake sale in ITC. Indus Towers, which reported a 20% increase in net profit to $221 million for the March 2024 quarter, remains an attractive asset, making this divestiture timely for both Vodafone and potential investors.

The stock has lost 7.7% over the past year compared with the industry�s decline of 13.3%.

Vodafone has hired Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas to manage the stake sale in Indian stock markets, the sources said.

Bank of America declined to comment while the others did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Vodafone in 2022 announced it would sell all of its then-28% stake, but has managed to sell only a small portion so far. The sources said the talks with rival telecom firms for a stake sale had not materialised.

Vodafone plans to repay part of its $42.17 billion net debt using proceeds from the Indus stake sale, the sources said.

Indus, which says it is one of the world's biggest tower companies, also counts India's second biggest telecom firm, Bharti Airtel, as a shareholder. It has nearly 220,000 towers, with services also including providing power, space and green technology for tower equipment. Private equity giant KKR and Canadian fund CPPIB were also investors in Indus, but sold their entire stakes in February.

Block deals, where investors sell shares in stock markets, have become increasingly popular in India as the market has surged to record highs.

In March, British American Tobacco sold its entire $2 billion stake in Indian tobacco firm ITC. For the March 2024 quarter, Indus' net profit rose 20% to $221 million, while its revenue stayed flat at $860 million, according to regulatory filings.

Why foreign billionaires are circling British telecoms,"When news of Carlos Slim�s �400m investment in BT reached bosses at the telecoms company, it was welcomed with cautious optimism. �I think it�s probably a net positive,� says one insider.
The reaction outside BT has been somewhat more effusive. Analysts viewed the decision by the Mexican telecoms billionaire to take a 3.2pc stake as a vote of confidence in new chief executive Allison Kirkby, coming as it did just weeks after she unveiled her plans for the company.
In a brief statement, Slim himself suggested the investment was �financial�. However, the tycoon�s swoop is not an isolated incident. Instead, it is the latest example of a foreign billionaire snapping up shares in British telecoms giants such as BT and Vodafone.

The flurry of interest has sparked speculation that Britain�s crucial infrastructure providers could become takeover targets. The interest will also no doubt provoke questions about what it means for the millions of people who use these telecoms companies� phone and internet services on a daily basis.
Bargain hunting lies at the heart of the trend. With share prices in the doldrums, opportunistic investors are buying up stakes on the cheap in the hope of capitalising on turnaround plans.
Slim, an 84-year-old billionaire who made his fortune in Latin American telecoms, has timed his approach prudently.
Kirkby last month outlined plans to double BT�s cash flow, cut �3bn in costs and return more money to shareholders in dividends. The investor-friendly strategy was rewarded with BT�s best day on the market in more than two decades.
�It feels like an endorsement of Allison�s strategy update, which was extremely well received by the investor community,� says Kester Mann at CCS Insight of Slim�s investment. �It�s a real shot in the arm for her.�
But the tycoon�s sudden presence has also raised eyebrows, especially given his track record in the sector. He previously bought a stake in Dutch telecoms firm KPN before mounting a failed takeover bid. He was also behind failed takeover swoops for both Telecom Italia and Portugal Telecom.
�Most likely it�s an opportunistic strategic investment aiming to capitalise on BT�s still fairly depressed share price,� says Mann. �But it could also be a bit of a beachhead to taking a stronger position in the company.�

Slim is not the only foreign billionaire on BT�s share register. French tycoon Patrick Drahi, who also made his money in telecoms, has built a stake of almost 25pc in the company.

These manoeuvres have fuelled speculation of a takeover bid � and BT has enlisted advisers at Robey Warshaw and Goldman Sachs to mount a possible defence.
The threat of a Drahi has receded as his Altice empire has been confronted with the mounting cost of its $60bn debt pile and corruption investigations in both France and Portugal.
Slim�s Grupo Carso has insisted its BT stake is a purely financial investment, while BT said it �welcomes any investor who recognises the long-term value of our business�.
Karen Egan at Enders Analysis adds that �pretty much everyone� has given up on the prospect of taking over BT because of strict national security laws.

But it is not only BT in billionaires� crosshairs. FTSE 100 rival Vodafone is fending off pressure from French tycoon Xavier Niel, who has acquired a 2.5pc stake in the company and is agitating for change.
Liberty Global, the US giant owned by so-called �cable cowboy� John Malone, also holds a stake of almost 5pc.
Elsewhere, smaller rival Three is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing�s CK Hutchison, though his holding will be diluted should a planned �15bn merger with Vodafone go ahead.

Driving this trend is a realisation that British telecoms stocks are undervalued. Even with their recent boost, BT�s shares are down by more than a third over the last five years. Vodafone�s shares have dropped by almost half over the same period.

Heavy investment in infrastructure such as 5G and full-fibre broadband has weighed on the company�s finances, while tough retail competition has put pressure on consumer prices and squeezed margins.
But now, with the bulk of this investment in the rear-view mirror, investors are seeing an opportunity.

�They are just undervalued and some of these investors are looking to seize opportunities, potentially short term, potentially longer term,� says Mann.

Egan adds that the telecoms industry can be �a bit impenetrable� to general investors given the complex technology and regulatory issues involved.

�It�s perhaps not surprising that we�re seeing experienced telecoms specialists buying into value stories that others struggle to get comfortable with,� she says.

At Vodafone, Niel also has other interests � namely the carving up of the company�s European operations.

Earlier this year, the French billionaire, also involved in telecoms, mounted a �10.5bn (�8.9bn) bid to merge Vodafone�s Italian business with his own company Iliad. However, this was rebuffed, with the British company ultimately choosing Swisscom instead.
The jilting has not gone down well with Niel. In an interview last weekend he said: �We�ve lost a lot of money since we bought our shares in Vodafone. And I�m not sure of the management of this company.�
It is not just billionaires who are interested in Britain�s phone-and-broadband providers: UAE-owned Etisalat has built a 15pc stake in Vodafone, becoming its biggest shareholder. The investment sparked an intervention from ministers, who warned there was a risk of �material influence� by the Gulf state.
The growing presence of foreign investors in a critical sector may also raise concerns for consumers who have been forced to swallow inflation-busting price rises in recent years.
Could these new shareholders drive BT and Vodafone to boost returns at the expense of investment in networks or push up prices for customers? Analysts say it is unlikely.

�If anything, people having confidence in [Kirkby�s] plan gives her additional confidence to pursue the strategy that she�s pursuing,� says Egan. �So I think it�s positive for her investment plans and investment in the UK.�
Still, the presence of a string of foreign billionaires on share registers means change could always be on the horizon � and bosses will have to be on their guard.

�I don�t see the strategy necessarily changing, but of course if these guys do take greater shares and become more influential there is always the potential that could change,� says Mann.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vodafone Spain plans 1,200 job cuts after acquisition by Zegona","MADRID (Reuters) -A former Vodafone unit in Spain that was recently acquired by Zegona Communications plans to cut up to 1,200 jobs, or just over a third of its total workforce, unions and the company said on Wednesday.

The plan comes after London-listed Zegona closed the 5 billion euro ($5.41 billion) acquisition last month.

Vodafone Spain, which has kept its brand name after reaching a 10-year agreement with Zegona, said in a statement it was convinced that the layoffs were the only way to guarantee its future viability and competitiveness.

The company, which said it has suffered a strong financial and commercial deterioration, cited economic, production and organisational reasons as behind its plans to cut costs.

Vodafone Spain's total revenues were down by 8% and it has lost approximately 400,000 contract customers in the last two years, it said.

""The voracity of a management incapable of devising real solutions to the real problems that have afflicted Vodafone Spain, and the inaction of an administration that did not ask for any guarantee for employment in the approval of the sale of Vodafone Spain to Zegona, come together,"" the UGT union said.

The former Vodafone unit is the third-largest telecom operator in Spain after the local units of Orange and Telefonica.

Zegona has previously bought and sold regional operators Telecable and Euskaltel in Spain.

This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years

How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?

Vodafone operates mobile and fixed-line networks and businesses in more than 20 countries. Its largest market is Germany, where it is the second mobile operator after Deutsche Telekom and owns a cable network after acquiring Kabel Deutschland in 2013 and Liberty Global Germany in 2019. In the UK, it acts mainly as a mobile operator, being the second largest player after BT Group. In 2024, Vodafone divested its Spanish and Italian divisions, given their low returns on invested capital.

A Glimpse at Vodafone Group PLC's Dividend History
Vodafone Group PLC has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1989. Dividends are currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.

Breaking Down Vodafone Group PLC's Dividend Yield and Growth
As of today, Vodafone Group PLC currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 10.08% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 10.05%. This suggests an expectation of decreased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to -7.10% per year. And over the past decade, Vodafone Group PLC's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -7.30%.

Based on Vodafone Group PLC's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Vodafone Group PLC stock as of today is approximately 6.97%.

Vodafone Group PLC's Dividend Analysis
Vodafone Group PLC's Dividend Analysis
The Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2024-03-31, Vodafone Group PLC's dividend payout ratio is 1.96, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.

Vodafone Group PLC's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Vodafone Group PLC's profitability 6 out of 10 as of 2024-03-31, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 6 years out of the past 10 years.

Growth Metrics: The Future Outlook
To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Vodafone Group PLC's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Vodafone Group PLC's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Vodafone Group PLC's revenue has decreased by approximately -3.00% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 77.75% of global competitors.

Next Steps
Considering Vodafone Group PLC's dividend payments, growth rate, payout ratio, profitability, and growth metrics, investors should weigh these factors carefully. While the high yield is attractive, the sustainability of dividends given the financial metrics presents a complex picture.

Swisscom gets first go ahead from Rome for Vodafone Italia acquisition,"MILAN (Reuters) - Swisscom has secured an initial go-ahead from Italy's government for its planned acquisition of Vodafone Italia, the Swiss telecoms company and a source close to the matter said on Tuesday.

So-called ""golden power"" legislation allows Rome to block or impose conditions on deals in sectors considered strategic such as banking, energy, telecommunications or healthcare.

Swisscom said in a statement that it had been informed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government of its decision not to use golden powers to veto the transaction.

The merger ""does not determine a threat of serious prejudice to national interests"", the group said as it detailed Rome's decision.

Swisscom said in March that it would buy Vodafone Italia for 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) and merge the business with its Italian subsidiary Fastweb in the latest round of consolidation in Europe's most competitive telecoms markets.

Asking not to be named, the source said the government would start a new golden power procedure once Meloni's office had been notified of the merger with Fastweb.

The integration will be subject to further scrutiny, the source added.

The deal is designed to create Italy's second biggest fixed-line broadband operator behind TIM, with a strong presence in the prized business segment, and a leading player in mobile.

Switzerland's leading telecommunications company said the takeover of Vodafone Italia was going according to schedule, with completion expected in the first quarter of 2025.

Vodafone gets green light for $5.41 billion sale of Spanish business,"(Reuters) -Vodafone said on Tuesday it received approval from Spanish authorities for the sale of its local unit to Zegona Communications for 5 billion euros ($5.41 billion).

The British mobile operator announced the sale of its Spanish business to Zegona in October, marking an exit from a market that has dragged on performance for years.

Vodafone intends to start an initial 500 million euros share buyback on Wednesday as part of the 2 billion euros it plans to return to investors in over 12 months.

Earlier in the day, the company reported a 2.2% rise in annual organic earnings after it returned to top-line growth in the final quarter on gains in Britain and Germany.

The London-listed company added the sale is expected to close at the end of the month.

Vodafone to halve dividend payments amid scramble to upgrade network,"Vodafone is to halve its dividend as the telecoms giant prepares to invest heavily in its mobile networks.

The FTSE 100 company announced a payout of 9 cents per share for 2024 but said it would slash this to 4.5 cents per share from next year �with an ambition to grow it over time�.

The company said: �The new dividend has been set at a sustainable level, which ensures appropriate cash flow cover and sufficient flexibility to invest in the business for growth.�

It came as Vodafone reported a return to revenue growth across the business in the fourth quarter as boss Margherita Della Valle�s turnaround plan starts to pay off.

The company posted a 6.3pc increase in service revenue � the amount of money made from its telecoms business � to �29.9bn (�25.7bn).

Overall revenues were down 2.5pc to �36.7bn after the sale of a stake in its towers business and the disposal of its operations in Hungary and Ghana last year.

Operating profit stood at �3.7bn, down by three-quarters from last year�s sharp increase. Shares rose as much as 3pc in early trading.

Under Ms Della Valle, Vodafone has been slimming down its European operations in a bid to return the sprawling group to growth.

Shares in the telecoms giant have slumped by more than 40pc over the last five years amid a squeeze on its margins in an increasingly competitive telecoms market.

Vodafone is close to finalising a �5bn deal to sell its Spanish business to Zegona, while it has struck an �8bn deal to sell its Italian operations to Swisscom.

The two divisions are now treated as discontinued operations and not included in Vodafone�s results. The company said it will use the proceeds of the deals to buy back up to �4bn in shares.

In the UK, Vodafone is hoping to push through its �15bn tie-up with Three. The deal has been cleared by ministers on national security grounds but is still facing an in-depth investigation by competition regulators amid fears it could push up prices for consumers.

Vodafone and Three have dismissed these concerns and argued the merger is needed to give them the scale to invest in 5G.

Vodafone also committed a further �100m to improving customer experience, including in its call centres. The company is two-thirds of the way through its plan to cut 11,000 jobs.

Vodafone last year returned to growth in its biggest market of Germany, with service revenue rising 0.2pc to �11.5bn. This was held back by a change to German TV laws that have hit its cable business. Earnings were down almost 6pc, which bosses blamed on higher energy costs and wider inflation.

In the UK, mobile service revenues rose 5.4pc, boosted by double-digit price rises earlier in the year.

Ms Della Valle said the company was seeing early benefits of its transformation plan but that �much more still needs to be done�.

She added: �We will step up investment in our customer experience, improve our underlying performance in Germany and accelerate our momentum in business, whilst also continuing to simplify our operations throughout the group. We are fundamentally transforming Vodafone for growth.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trending tickers: Anglo American, GameStop, Vodafone, Greggs and Novavax","Anglo American has announced a group restructuring that includes the sale of several assets to boost its portfolio, a day after rejecting a mega takeover bid from Australian rival BHP (BHP.L).

As part of the split, the miner will divest or demerge its diamond unit De Beers, spin off its platinum-metals subsidiary Anglo American Platinum, and sell its steelmaking coal assets, while exploring options for putting its nickel operation on care and maintenance before divesting it.

The reorganisation will reduce costs by $1.7bn (�1.36bn), it said.
The announcement comes a day after the London-listed miner rejected a sweetened �34bn offer from BHP, saying it continued to significantly undervalue the company and was �highly unattractive� for its shareholders.

�We expect that a radically simpler business will deliver sustainable incremental value creation through a step change in operational performance and cost reduction,� chief executive Duncan Wanblad said.

Investors still believe that BHP will lift its offer again and possibly add cash before 22 May, the deadline under UK rules to return with a binding offer or walk way.

""The language in the release suggests it's not the best and final offer,"" Todd Warren, a portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, told Reuters.

Shares in GameStop, the video game retailer whose popularity among pandemic-era traders helped coin the idea of a meme stock, were surging in pre-market trading after a single post by a social media account named �Roaring Kitty�.

The internet persona, whose real name is Keith Gill, posted a picture on X of a video gamer leaning forward on their chair as if to indicate he�s taking the game seriously, making his first post on the platform since 2021.

Gill is a day trader whose videos during the meme-stock bubble encouraged millions of others into the market, in turn propelling stocks such as GameStop to record heights.
The tweet was enough to drive a rally in GameStop on Monday which caused losses approaching $1bn for short sellers, according to data from S3 Partners.

With GameStop soaring 74%, short-selling hedge funds suffered a mark-to-market loss of $838m in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer, data firm S3 Partners said.

Vodafone has reported a 2.2% rise in organic earnings for 2024, meeting market forecasts, after it returned to top-line growth in the final quarter helped by gains in the UK and Germany.

The UK-listed company revealed an 11.3% decline in underlying profits last year to �11bn (�9.5bn) and a 2.5% fall in revenue to �36.7bn (�31.5bn).

It said revenues were hit by the disposals of Vantage Towers, Vodafone Hungary and Vodafone Ghana in the prior financial year and adverse exchange rate movements.

Germany returned to growth with service revenue increasing by 0.2% for the full year and 0.6% for the fourth quarter, the company said, but adjusted core earnings dropped by 5.8% due to higher energy and other inflationary costs.

""Much more still needs to be done in the year ahead,"" said chief executive Margherita Della Valle.

Free cash flow fell from �2.6bn to �1.8bn. Net debt, excluding the sold segments of Spain and Italy, was broadly flat at �33.2bn.

Mark Crouch, analyst at eToro, said: ""Vodafone investors may have been bracing themselves for another tumultuous earnings report this morning and while this might not have them jumping for joy, there are signs the business has turned a corner.""

Greggs reported sales growth of 7.4% as the bakery chain remains on track to open between 140 and 160 new stores in 2024.

The firm reported a 7.4% rise in like-for-like sales for the first 19 weeks of 2024, with total sales in the period hitting �693m.

Greggs added that its new range of iced drinks was �performing well�, with plans to roll it out further from the current 300 shops to up to 700 in the coming months.

Since the start of the year Greggs has opened 64 stores, and closed 37 � including relocations � giving a total of 2,500 shops trading nationwide.

Shares of Novavax jumped as much as 50% as Wall Street cheered a new multibillion-dollar deal with French drugmaker Sanofi (SAN.PA) that kicked off a dramatic turnaround for the struggling vaccine maker.

Novavax signed a $1.2bn licensing agreement with Sanofi that includes commercialising a combined COVID-19 and flu shot.

The pharma company reported a first-quarter 2024 loss of $1.05 cents per share while revenues in the quarter came in at $94m, below expectations of $101m. Still, the top line rose 16% on a year-over-year basis.

It recorded $11.5m of revenues from royalties and adjuvant sales to licensing partners compared with the year-ago quarter�s revenues of $1m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stocks to watch this week: Burberry, Vodafone, BT and Walmart","Earnings season continues, and investors have some high expectations for some of the major companies reporting next week such as Vodafone and Burberry.

Here's what to look out for:

Vodafone (VOD.L) � Reports on Tuesday 14 May
Vodafone shares have struggled and they rank among the worst performing FTSE 100 names over the past 5 years. So why would investors keep tabs on the telecoms operator when it presents its full-year results next Tuesday?

Chief executive Margherita Della Valle took the helm in January 2023 and last May launched a major overhaul which has seen the company try to merge its UK assets with those of Three and sell both its Italian and Spanish operations in two deals with a combined value of �12bn (�13bn, .

""Vodafone�s recent third-quarter results provided some optimism for investors to cling to, but wider issues remain,� Matt Britzman, equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, said.

Investors should focus on the timing on the sale of the Spanish and Italian businesses and any updates on the Competition and Markets Authority�s investigation into the proposed merger of Vodafone�s UK assets with those of Three.

�The regulator, thus far, does not seem to welcome the plan. Margherita Della Valle hopes these deals will complete the reorganisation that she targeted back in May 2023 and will leave the company with a new, five-pronged reporting structure, of Germany, UK, Other Europe, Turkey and Africa,� Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.

�Also watch out for any comment on the proposed �2bn share buybacks after completion of each of the Spanish and Italian deals,� they noted.

Over the past year, Vodafone shares rank 92nd within the FTSE 100. In terms of share price change and over the past five years, they rank 93rd, thanks to a fall of more than 50%, according to AJ Bell.

Burberry (BRBY.L) � Reports on Wednesday 15 May
Luxury goods group Burberry will tell investors if London is still missing out to Paris and Milan as a tourist destination for high-spending shoppers as it presents its full-year results on Wednesday.
AJ Bell tells us that analysts currently expect total sales of �2.9bn, a 1% drop on a constant currency basis, and an adjusted operating profit of around �405mn.

That is with a forecast �120m hit to sales and a �60m hit to profits from currency movements. Adjust for that and operating profit is seen reaching �465mn for a margin of 15.8%.

�Burberry�s shares have more than halved in the past year, to leave them back near the lows plumbed during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 (although the �10 mark provided support then, as it did in 2016 and 2012, so it will be interesting to see if that level is breached or holds this time around),� Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth wrote.

Investors should focus on comparing momentum in the third quarter compared to that shown earlier in the year. Any updates on the company�s capital allocation policy will be of interest as analysts now expect Burberry to cut its total dividend to 52p a share from 61p a share.

BT (BT-A.L) � Reports on Thursday 16 May
BT shares are currently back at levels first seen in the immediate aftermath of the company�s stock market flotation in late 1984 � when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Nigel Lawson was chancellor of the exchequer.

Increased competition, regulation and debt leading to minimal profit progression, has lead to a sharp decline in the stock, as well as dividend cuts.

New boss Allison Kirkby reaffirmed full-year guidance, alongside the third-quarter update back in February, as Openreach continues to build out Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) to improve the nation�s broadband infrastructure, and as EE adds business and retail customers alike.
BT is expecting growth in both sales and adjusted EBITDA for the year to March 2024. Consensus forecasts are looking for 2.1% sales growth to �20.9bn and a 2% increase in adjusted EBITDA to �8.1bn, ahead of a 0.8% gain and 1.4% gain to �21bn and �8.3bn respectively in fiscal 2025.
The company also expects capital investment of �5bn in the year to March, compared to �5.3bn a year ago, and free cash flow of between �1.0bn and �1.2bn, down from �1.3bn.

Analysts think capex will be flat and free cash flow up modestly in the coming year.
No change is expected in BT�s annual dividend of 7.7p a share and the firm does not run a share buyback programme.
Walmart (WMT) � Reports on Thursday 16 May
Walmart will report earnings before the bell on Thursday and for the April-ended quarter analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect adjusted profit of 52 cents a share, up 6% year over year. Revenue is forecast to rise 4.5% to $159.2bn.

Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer, and John David Rainey, executive vice president and chief financial officer, will host a call on the day to discuss the results and answer questions.
It comes as holiday-quarter earnings and revenue for the January-ended quarter accelerated from the prior quarter, up 7% and 6%, respectively. Meanwhile, global e-commerce revenue increased 23% and topped $100bn. In the US alone, e-commerce revenue rose 17%.

It also recently announced plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio for $2.3bn, or 11.50 a share, and said it would open or expand more than 150 stores in America over the next five years.

UK grants conditional security clearance for Vodafone-Three merger,"(Reuters) -The British government on Thursday made a final order to conditionally approve the proposed merger between Vodafone's UK operation and Hutchison's Three UK, following a detailed national security assessment of the telecom deal.

The UK's Cabinet Office said security conditions to approve the deal include the companies setting up a ""National Security Committee"" to oversee sensitive work that relates to or could affect national security.

A separate investigation into the merger by Britain's competition regulator is ongoing, after the watchdog last month said it would need to open an in-depth investigation after the parties did not offer remedies to ease competition concerns.

The tie-up between Vodafone and Three, announced last year, will reduce the number of mobile networks in Britain from four to three.

In a joint statement, Vodafone and Three said they were pleased with the national security approval and would continue to work with the Competition and Markets Authority.

""We strongly believe (the merger) will strengthen competition in the UK's mobile sector and enable a significant step-up in the UK's mobile network infrastructure,"" they said.

Under conditions laid out, the security committee set up by the companies will be required to provide regular updates and information to the UK government and the order also requires the telecom firms to establish a technical group within the committee to monitor specific topics.

Vodafone's PairPoint trying to turn mobile device sim cards into crypto wallets,"Vodafone will use SIM card technology to meet an anticipated surge in demand for cryptocurrency on mobile phones.

CPO of Pairpoint by Vodafone David Palmer spoke to Yahoo Finance Future Focus about how the company is advancing the use of blockchain on mobile devices to manage crypto transactions.

""Within each mobile phone is a SIM card and we have focused on linking the mobile phone SIM card to digital wallets, identity and blockchains, using the cryptography we have in those SIM cards for that blockchain integration,"" Palmer told Yahoo Finance.

Palmer outlined how the company's Pairpoint brand is advancing web3 and Internet of Things (IoT) services by utilising SIM card technology for blockchain-based digital wallets on mobile devices. ""Pairpoint provides a secure digital platform that allows vehicles, devices, and machines to autonomously and seamlessly interact and trade with each other,"" the Vodafone website said.

Surge in blockchain-based digital wallets
Palmer believes there will be 5.6 billion blockchain-based digital wallets by 2030, and that they will be the gateway to financial services.

Palmer highlighted the use of public blockchains like ethereum (ETH-USD). He noted the increasing speed and security of blockchains but acknowledged regulatory hurdles.

""Long term the pathway is towards using public blockchains such as the ethereum network, and with the ethereum fork, we are starting to see that public blockchains are becoming faster and more secure,"" Palmer added.

But he acknowledged regulatory barriers, adding that ""with mainstream financial services there are regulations that prevent them using public blockchains because of sanctions"".

Vodafone's digital asset broker platform
One of Vodafone's (VOD.L) key innovations in this sector is the PairPoint digital asset broker platform. Palmer detailed how ParPoint can facilitate transactions between public blockchains, such as the ethereum network, and private blockchains such as Onyx by JPMorgan, which employs smart contracts for seamless integration.


He said: ""We act as a middleman for large enterprises that wish to write to a public blockchain. These large financial services can link to Vodafone's blockchain, it is logged there and then a smart contract using things like account abstraction, allows cross chain interoperability.""

Vodafone's digital asset broker platform followed their early experiments with peer-to-peer micro-payment transactions. Vodafone later integrated its SIM card technology with blockchain, introducing interoperable 'digital identity passports'. These passports, anchored on the blockchain, securely store private keys to digital wallets within the SIM card's hardware module.

This culminated in the creation of Vodafone's Pairpoint platform, providing internet of things (IoT) devices with decentralised digital identities, and enabling them to operate across organisational and system boundaries.

Palmer illustrated this concept with scenarios where devices equipped with hardware wallets could autonomously authenticate and execute transactions � for example, an electric autonomous vehicle could pay for its own charging at a charging station.

But Palmer warned of the importance of securing these wallets against cyber threats, and acknowledged that they will be prime targets for hackers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mobile firms to miss deadline to fix rural �not-spots�,"Mobile firms are set to miss a deadline to tackle so-called signal �not spots� in rural areas after the Government rejected their pleas for an extension.

Dean Creamer, head of Building Digital UK (BDUK), the government body overseeing a �1bn project to improve rural coverage, said officials had blocked a request from operators to push back the initial deadline by 18 months.

Speaking in front of MPs on the Public Accounts Committee, he said: �That wasn�t accepted and we haven�t agreed that and we�ve said that Ofcom will make that assessment as expected.�

The Telegraph last year revealed that Vodafone, Three and Virgin Media O2 had written to the Government asking for an extension to the project�s initial deadline, which requires operators to expand their coverage to reach 88pc of the UK�s landmass by June.

Operators are working on an industry-wide scheme that will help hit the target, known as the Shared Rural Network.

Any delays could prove costly. Ofcom has the power to fine companies up to 10pc of their global turnover if they fail to meet the targets, though officials insisted that any response would be �reasonable�.

BT-owned EE, which has more mobile masts than its rivals and is contributing to the initial phase of the rural coverage project separately, reached its initial target earlier this year.

However, other mobile firms have struggled to build enough masts to plug the gaps in coverage that have plagued rural communities. Bosses have blamed the slow progress on the pandemic, as well as difficulties in securing planning permissions.

The setback on hitting the initial deadline will spark fears that the Government will fail to meet its target of delivering 4G coverage to 95pc of the UK landmass by the end of next year and to the entire country by early 2027.

In a report published in February, the National Audit Office said the programme was running behind schedule and warned that high inflation had driven up costs.

Mobile firms have insisted the final deadline is not at risk, while officials pointed out that operators could catch up even if they miss the initial targets.

Mr Creamer said: �In terms of the way the programme has been structured, there is clearly a big gap between that first licence obligation and then the target. So there is significant contingency, if you like, built into that, which is now being used.�

The Shared Rural Network is one of the key pledges drawn up by former prime minister Boris Johnson under plans to �level up the country�.

Phase one of the project is focused on �partial not spot� areas where at least one operator provides coverage but not all of them. Phase two, which will be funded by the Government, will target �total not spot� areas, where no operators currently provide 4G services.

Any delays will be met by anger from rural campaign groups and could spark accusations that the Conservative Party is letting down countryside voters.

A Virgin Media O2 spokesman said: �We have already built more new sites than any other operator and remain committed to doing everything we can to deliver better mobile connectivity to rural areas.�

A Vodafone spokesman said: �We remain committed to delivering on all elements of the SRN programme and have successfully introduced 4G to rural locations across the UK as part of the wider project which is due for delivery by Jan 2027. We have recently gone live with our 200th site bringing geographic 4G coverage to 83pc of the UK, on track to deliver the Government�s 95pc SRN coverage target by December 2025.�

A spokesman for Three declined to comment.  The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology was contacted for comment.

A government spokesman said: �Mobile Network Operators are responsible for delivering the first part of the Shared Rural Network and legally bound to reach 88pc geographic coverage by June 2024.

�The Shared Rural Network has already delivered substantial improvements to mobile coverage across the UK with 4G geographic coverage now at 93.2pc.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best and worst UK mobile phone providers,"Mobile provider Three has been names the worst UK mobile phone provider, according to a new survey by consumer group Which?, scoring 60% and receiving only two stars in all categories it was assessed on.

The survey asked 3,739 customers in January about their satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, value for money and network speeds. Smaller networks outshone the big four providers, offering better value for money.

Smaller providers piggyback on the infrastructure of a parent network, while shunning the unpredictable inflation-linked price hikes favoured by larger companies.

""Consumers unhappy with their current provider should consider switching, which is easy to do, and can save them money and improve their customer experience,"" said Natalie Hitchins, Which? head of home products and services.

Worst performers
Three (60%)
Three is the smallest of the four major networks and is currently attempting to merge with Vodafone to clinch a bigger share of the market.

Nearly half (46%) of Three customers reported having a problem in the past 12 months. This compares poorly to top-performing networks such as iD Mobile and Tesco, where only 11% and 12% of customers had issues.

�We are disappointed with the results of this survey and take the results very seriously,"" a Three spokesperson said. ""Improving customer experience is a huge focus area for the business and we are working on a number of internal measures to significantly reduce complaints and poor performance. Delivering a great experience for our customers is our absolute priority and drives everything we do at Three.�

Vodafone (68%)
Meanwhile, Vodafone (VOD.L) scored 68%. It received just two stars for the incentives and rewards it offers but was rated four stars for network reliability.

A possible upcoming merger between Vodafone and Three is likely to reduce competitive pressure in the market and could lead to higher prices and lower quality for consumers � at least in the short term.

02 (68%)
O2, which also scored 68%, is the only network to still use the outdated and arguably inaccurate inflation metric Retail Price Index (RPI), plus 3.9%, to work out its yearly price increases. RPI is an unofficial statistic that measures consumer inflation. It is tracked by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) alongside the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

This year, RPI is 0.9% higher than CPI (last year it was 2.9% higher) and has meant O2 customers experiencing 8.8% hikes on airtime this year. O2 has noted that some customers, who took out their contracts prior to March 2021, pay increases which are based on RPI only, without the 3.9% added on.

O2�s incentives and rewards as well as its technical support rating dipped to two stars, but all other scores remained at three stars.

EE (69%)
EE scored 69%. The UK network with the most customers returned a solid but unspectacular result. A mixture of two-star and three-star ratings showed that customers were not hugely impressed � its main highlight being a four-star rating for network reliability.

Best performers
At the top end of the table, a running theme was providers offering excellent value for money. All but one of Which?�s ""Recommended"" or ""Great Value"" providers got five stars for this metric.

Tesco Mobile (83%)
Tesco Mobile (TSCO.L) received the highest customer score of 83% but was not a Which? Recommended Provider because customers that are not signed up to one of its Clubcard-connected plans face inflation-based mid-contract price increases.

Smarty (82%)
Smarty scored 82%. Almost two-thirds of Smarty customers rated it as excellent value for money. Smarty is owned by Three � rated as the worst provider in the survey � and uses its mobile network.

Other networks:
GiffGaff scored 80%

Voxi, 77%

iD Mobile, 77%

Lebara, 76%

The Big Four mobile providers all performed poorly for value for money, which could be partly linked to their use of unpredictable mid-contract price hikes. EE has already recently put a stop to these hikes for new and re-contracting customers rather than waiting for regulator Ofcom to force them to.

Which?�s latest research shows that if people are unhappy with their current provider, there are some good options out there for saving money and getting better customer service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy for Under $20,"In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most undervalued stocks to buy that are trading under $20. If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy for Under $20.

Slowly and steadily, the stock market is on its way fully forgetting the trauma of 2022. Back then, rapid and large interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve coupled with an inflationary spike from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the lax monetary policies of the coronavirus pandemic had depressed stocks and shocked high growth areas such as consumer technology and biotechnology. Then, the tail end of 2022 saw artificial intelligence stocks become the market's saving grace, and with a quarter of 2024 behind us, major stock indexes have soared to set new records.

One of the more popular approaches to investing is sifting out undervalued stocks. These are stocks that are believed to be trading below their intrinsic value on the stock market, and investors pile into them with the hopes that the price can appreciate in the future to provide a profit taking opportunity. One popular way of sifting out undervalued stocks is by looking at a firm's price to earnings ratio. There are primarily three kinds of P/E ratios. These are the price to trailing, the price to forward, and the price to current earnings ratios. The three divide the share price with the latest four quarter earnings, the forecast earnings, and the latest annual earnings, respectively. Among these, the trailing and forward earnings ratios are most commonly used.

When it. comes to sifting out undervalued stocks from the thousands that change hands on markets every day, the P/E ratio is compared with the industry average. If it's lower than the industry average or other comparable firms, then the stock is undervalued. Another method to see whether a stock might be undervalued is by looking at its analyst share price target. The greater the positive difference between the price target and the actual price, the more the stock is undervalued. This approach also ties into the broader approach of value investing that has been followed by Wall Street greats such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. If you're interested in some value stocks, then you can take a look at 13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman.

Building on this, one could argue that if the correct undervalued stocks are picked, then the hypothesis of them delivering returns through share price performance as the market 'catches on' to underlying fundamental strengths can also lead to hefty returns. One way in which one can pick out the right undervalued stocks is to look at what the hedge funds are doing. If you've been following Insider Monkey regularly and have subscribed to our newsletter, you'll know that we regularly cover hedge fund stock picks. One such piece covered the top hedge fund undervalued small cap stock picks in December 2023 that used hedge fund holdings for the third quarter of 2023. By analyzing the performance of these stocks over the past six months, we can see whether undervalued stocks, particularly those picked by hedge funds are really worth their salt.

In good news for the hedge funds (and for us) the average share price performance of these 16 stocks, i.e. the sum of their negative or positive percentage price movements divided by the number of the stocks, is 9.59%. So, had you invested in these stocks by the end of September 2023, your money would be worth 9.59% more. The next thing to check for these undervalued stocks is to see their performance bands. Within this list, the best performing value stock was Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLAY), while the worst performing undervalued stock was Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF). The two stocks' six month share price performance is 84.84% and -40.95%, respectively.

One undervalued hedge fund stock pick that hasn't done so well is Target Hospitality Corp. (NASDAQ:TH).  So, what were the hedge funds saying about this stock (down 30.54%) at the close of the fourth quarter of 2023, i.e., three months after our investment horizon?

Well, here's a snippet from Jackson Peak Capital's fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter:

For the detractors, the largest was Target Hospitality. This was an event-driven investment predicated on a thesis that government contracts relating to the crisis at the US Southern Border would lead to a meaningful re-rating of the company�s equity. Ultimately, our thesis on the company receiving the contract was correct although the structure of the contract was suboptimal. If the structure was more fortuitous, this investment would have made us multiples of what we lost, so this is why we thought the risk-reward was attractive ex ante.

So, if you're wondering which undervalued stocks under $20 are on the hedge fund radar, take a look below to find out. A couple of notable picks are Petr�leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), and Roivant Sciences Ltd. (NASDAQ:ROIV).

13 Cheap High Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 13 Cheap High Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Cheap High Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now.

Dividend investing strategies especially those with a focus on high yields have taken a backseat in the recent past amid a broader shift towards growth stocks. The rise of AI further dampened the appeal of investing money just for the sake of steady dividends. Yields have also declined over the past few decades.

Can Dividend Investing Make a Comeback?
According to a report by the Financial Times, about 70% of the S&P 500 companies pay dividends but most of these payouts are small, and yields are hovering around 2% over the past two decades. But the report said that there has been a subtle shift towards dividend investing, triggered by a general disappointment and high volatility that comes with solely focusing on high growth stocks. Many dividend-focused indices and markets have performed well recently, urging investors in the US to consider income stocks. For example, Italy�s FTSE MIB, where average dividend yield is about 4%, gained 39% in 2023, compared to the S&P 500 return of just 26%, on a total return basis.

The FT report quoted Hans-J�rg Naumer, global head of thematic research at Allianz Global, who said that �an income stream� helps to overcome the feeling of loss in investing.

Returns and Performance of High-Yield Dividend Stocks
While investing experts never recommend solely focusing on high yields without paying attention to underlying business and long-term catalysts, high dividend stocks have had strong historical returns in the past especially during high interest rate environment which make them worthy of a detailed examination today. For example, a 2018 report by Global X took a look at the performance of high dividend stocks during high interest rate periods. The report said that high dividend stocks generated on average annual dividend yield of 6.4% from 1960 through 2017, while these stocks outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.0% on an annualized basis.

Investing in Dividend Stocks When Interest Rates are Rising
Should you invest in high dividend stocks when interest rates are rising or high or should you continue to prefer safer dividend stocks with average yields like Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO). The Global X report said that high dividend stocks outperformed the S&P 500 during 7 out of the 10 rising interest rate periods since 1960 through 2017.

Another research conducted at the University of Nevada, entitled Which One Is Better Off: Investing In High Dividend Or Low Dividend Stocks?,  in 2014, took a look at portfolios of high dividend yield stocks, low dividend yield stocks and medium yield stocks to gauge the performance of these categories of stocks over the long run. The research found that high dividend portfolios outperform low and medium dividend portfolios over a longer period of time.

""The average return in each year indicates that the high dividend yield portfolio beat the low dividend portfolio in 16 out of the 26 single year periods in the entire sample. For high dividend yield portfolios, average return is 10.82% and geometric return is 9.27% with a minimum return -42.07% in 2007 and a maximum return 35.3% in 1994. For medium dividend yield portfolios, average return is 8.34% and geometric mean is 7.03% with a minimum return -28% in 2000 and a maximum return 41.51% in 1994. For low dividend yield portfolios, average return is 3.3% and geometric return is 0.76% with a minimum return -43.15% in 2007 and a maximum return is 2012. This analysis confirms that in the long run the high dividend portfolios performed better than the moderate and low dividend yield portfolios. The overall average return of Top Ten portfolios was over three times higher than overall average return of the low dividend yield portfolios and over 2% higher than the average return of the medium dividend yield portfolios. What�s more, the annual compound return of high dividend yield portfolio is more than nine times higher than the annual compound return of low dividend yield portfolio.""

Performance of High Dividend Stocks in 2024?
Having said that, it�s important to see how have high dividend yield stocks been performing this year? Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM), which tracks the performance of companies that pay dividends that generally are higher than average, is up 6.2% year to date through April 8, compared to the 9% gain posted by the broader market. But the ETF is up 36% over the past one year, compared to the S&P 500�s gain of about 26%. Over the past five years the S&P 500 is up 79% while the VYM ETF has gained about 36%. The ETF saw huge declines in 2020 amid massive dividend cuts and suspensions triggered by the coronavirus crisis.

McDonald�s buys hundreds of Israel franchise restaurants after Hamas war triggers boycotts,"McDonald�s is to buy back 225 of its restaurants in Israel after the fast food chain blamed a boycott in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war for a slump in sales.

The US company said it had struck a deal to buy the restaurants from Israeli franchise Alonyal, which has owned and operated the chain�s outlets in the country for more than 30 years.

The deal will return 225 restaurants with more than 5,000 employees back to McDonald�s ownership. Terms were not disclosed.

McDonald�s has found itself embroiled in controversy since the early days of the Gaza conflict after the Israeli franchise said it had given away thousands of free meals to Israeli soldiers.

The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, a pro-Palestinan organisation, urged consumers to shun the fast food chain as franchisees �openly supported� the Israeli military, while franchise groups in countries such as Kuwait and Pakistan distanced themselves from the Israeli firm.

In response, McDonald�s said it had no position on the war and that its franchisees around the world were free to act independently.

Chris Kempczinski, president and chief executive of McDonald�s, called the backlash �disheartening and ill-founded� and blamed it on �misinformation�.

He said the controversy was responsible for the chain�s first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years and warned that trading in the Middle East would not improve as long as the conflict continued.

In a statement on Thursday, McDonald�s said it �remains committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience in the market going forward�.

Omri Padan, chief executive and owner of Alonyal Limited, said: �For more than 30 years, Alonyal Limited has been proud to bring the Golden Arches to Israel and serve our communities.

�We�ve grown the brand to be the leading and most successful restaurant chain in Israel and are grateful to our management, employees, suppliers, and customers who made this possible. We are encouraged by what the future holds.�

The majority of McDonald�s restaurants around the world are run by franchisees, which pay the US corporation a fee to license its brand and recipes.

The strategy has helped to cement the chain�s status as one of the largest global brands, but means it cannot dictate central company policy in the event of a crisis.

McDonald�s is one of a number of major corporations that have been targeted by activists during the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Starbucks last year sued a staff union in Iowa for expressing solidarity with Palestine in a social media post, sparking fury from both pro-Israel groups who condemned the post and pro-Palestine campaigners who called for a boycott in response to the lawsuit.

European house prices drop as France and Germany stagnate
European house prices have dropped for the first time in a decade after Germany and France suffered stagnant economic growth.

In the final quarter of 2023, house prices fell 0.7pc in the euro zone and 0.3pc in the EU compared with the previous quarter.

Prices in France fell 2.7pc, Denmark by 2.3pc and Germany by 2pc. However, eastern European countries tended to do better, with prices in Poland rising 4.8pc.

Ricardo Amaro at Oxford Economics told the FT that slow growth in Germany, where house prices dropped 7.1pc over a full year, �is adding to caution from actual and prospective buyers and the strong house price surge during the pandemic also left the German market vulnerable to a correction.�

McDonald�s to buy Israeli franchise amid Middle East controversy
McDonald�s is to buy out its Israeli franchise operator after it generated controversy by giving free meals to Israeli soldiers.

The fast food giant has faced protests and calls for boycotts as a result, and has said that �misinformation� is harming sales.

It has now has agreed to buy the 225 restaurants run by franchisee Alonyal in Israel.

In January, McDonald�s boss Chris Kempczinski said: �Several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald�s.

�This is disheartening and ill-founded. In every country where we operate, including in Muslim countries, McDonald�s is proudly represented by local owner operators who work tirelessly to serve and support their communities while employing thousands of their fellow citizens.�

The majority of McDonald�s restaurants around the world are run by franchisees.

McDonald�s operators in countries including Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Pakistan have publicly said they don�t support the actions of the franchised restaurants in Israel.

McDonald�s international president Jo Sempels today said: �McDonald�s remains committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience in the market going forward.�

Omri Padan, owner of Alonyal, said: �For more than 30 years, Alonyal Limited has been proud to bring the Golden Arches to Israel and serve our communities. We�ve grown the brand to be the leading and most successful restaurant chain in Israel and are grateful to our management, employees, suppliers, and customers who made this possible. We are encouraged by what the future holds.�

Bloomberg said that McDonald�s plans to find a new franchisee for its business in Israel, according to an Israeli media report.

The agreement is subject to conditions and could take several months to be completed.

McDonald�s has been approached for comment.

Business groups sound alarm over Dover animal tax
New fees that will be imposed on animal and plant products coming through the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel from the end of the month have been attacked by business leaders.

The charges, published by the Government yesterday, will fund biosecurity checks.

The Cold Chain Federation�s chief executive, Phil Pluck, told Sky News: �Ultimately, this will increase business costs and food prices and potentially lower choices for the shopper.�

The Government has �failed to listen� to business over the flat-rate charges, the British Chambers of Commerce has claimed. Will Bain, the body�s head of trade policy, said: �Importing a small consignment of goods with only five different meat, poultry, egg, milk or some fish products in the medium risk category will now face a bill of �145 per package under these proposals.

Elon Musk�s X starts gives out free blue ticks in latest strategy shift
Elon Musk�s X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, has begun restoring free blue ticks for some of its users in a reversal of Mr Musk�s move to make people pay.

For years, Twitter�s blue ticks were largely reserved for celebrities, politicians and other influential accounts to provide verification that the user was genuine. That changed months after Musk bought the platform for $44bn (�35bn) in October 2022.

Last year, X began issuing verification checks only to those who paid the starting paying for it, and stripping verification badges from many celebrities and other prominent accounts.

But now, numerous users have reported seeing the blue ticks return to their accounts, or appear for the first time, despite the fact that they were not paying for the premium service on X.

Revenues for the quarter ending February 25 were $1.6bn (�1.3bn), a drop of 8pc compared with the year before. The clothing company made a loss of $11m compared with a profit of $115m. This was as a result of $116.2m of restructuring charges after cutting its workforce by 12pc.

Investors responded positively to an increase in full-year profit guidance.

Co-op to launch crackdown on middle-class shoplifting
Co-op is to launch a crackdown on a surge in middle-class shoplifting after it suffered a �70m hit from store thefts last year. Hannah Boland reports:

Matt Hood, the Co-op Food managing director, said it was installing more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in its convenience stores to help monitor what customers were putting in their shopping bags at its self-service checkouts.

He said: �We are looking at what we can do around AI and what we can do with that linkage to our CCTV cameras.�

This would help them to �reduce the potential increase in middle-class crime�, Mr Hood said, adding there was �some evidence� that self-service machines led to more theft.

It follows moves by US rivals to start pulling the technology from stores in a bid to reduce shoplifting rates.

Goldman Sachs reports highest gender pay gap in six years
Goldman Sachs� gender pay gap has widened to its worst level in six years, with women paid less than half what men earn. Michael Bow has the details:

Women employed at Goldman Sachs International, which has offices in London, Birmingham and Milton Keynes, earned 54pc less per hour than men on average in 2023, according to the group�s latest gender pay report.

In pounds and pence terms, it means a typical female Goldman employee earned 46p for every �1 earned by a male colleague.

The Wall Street bank�s gender pay gap widened from 53.2pc in 2022. Last year�s figure was the worst since Goldman first began publishing data on the issue in 2017. Then, the gender pay gap stood at 55.6pc.

The gulf between the size of men and women�s bonuses stood at 67.4pc last year, though more women than men received performance-linked payouts.

Goldman has the worst gender pay gap of all the big Wall Street banks based in London.

JP Morgan�s ratio fell to 47pc last year and Morgan Stanley�s figure also declined to 48pc.

The data is based on the average of what Goldman pays all men and women in the UK, regardless of their role. Men and women working in similar roles are paid equally.

Goldman has more male staff in higher paying senior roles, which leads to the imbalance. Staff in lower paid roles are overwhelmingly women.

A Goldman spokesperson said: �Importantly, this gender pay gap report does not account for pay in similar roles or tenure, but we know that we need to do more to increase representation of women at the senior-most levels of the firm.�

DS Smith suitor lays out plans for London listing if �5.7bn takeover approved
The US company eyeing a multibillion-pound takeover battle for one of Britain�s biggest packaging companies has said that it would establish a European headquarters in London and seek to list its shares in the City.

International Paper said that if it is successful with a potential bid for DS Smith it would keep the company�s existing headquarters.

It said that �key elements� of the functions at DS Smith�s London office would be maintained, subject to �consultation with impacted employees�.

International Paper would also �seek a secondary listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange�, it said.

The Memphis-based company had previously said it might be interested in making a �5.7bn offer for DS Smith, which would be paid in shares.

It came after DS Smith already agreed a �5.1bn deal with London-listed rival Mondi in principle.

The business said that if a deal goes ahead it expects that it could save around $514m (�407m) a year within four years through savings on freight and the size of its purchases when negotiating deals with suppliers.

DS Smith shares rose 1.4pc.

More Americans claiming jobless benefits in tight labour market
The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits rose to their highest level in two months last week, but layoffs remain at historically low levels as the labor market remains resilient despite elevated interest rates.

The Labor Department reported that filings for unemployment claims for the week ending March 30 climbed by 9,000 to 221,000 from the previous week�s 212,000.

The four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the weekly volatility, rose modestly to 214,250, an increase of 2,750 from the previous week.

In total, 1.79 million Americans were collecting jobless benefits during the week that ended March 23, a decline of 19,000 from the previous week.

Weekly unemployment claims are considered a proxy for the number of US layoffs in a given week and a sign of where the job market is headed. They have remained at historically low levels since the pandemic purge of millions of jobs in the spring of 2020.

The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark borrowing rate 11 times beginning in March of 2022 in an effort to bring down the four-decade high inflation that took hold after the economy roared back from the Covid recession of 2020. Part of the Fed�s goal was to loosen the labour market and cool wage growth, which it believes contributed to persistently high inflation.

However, commentators think that workers are enjoying �the best jobs market in the past half century with wages now outpacing inflation�:

Threat to petrol supplies as tanker drivers vote to strike
Union bosses have threatened to disrupt petrol supplies across Britain later this month as tanker drivers prepare to go on strike.

Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the details:

Unite claimed transport company JW Suckling �failed to come to the table� to discuss better pensions for its drivers, who transport fuel to garages.

Drivers who are members of Unite have now voted to take industrial action in the row over retirement benefits and pay. In total, 39 drivers across London, the South East and Scotland are expected to take part in continuous strikes from April 16.

Unite claimed this could hit supplies in some parts of the UK, although it is not expected to cause widespread issues.

The threat of petrol disruptions is yet another headache for beleaguered drivers, who have faced a series of issues at the pumps in recent years.

HRT drug deal could raise prices, watchdog warns
The competition watchdog has found that women needing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) might see higher prices if a deal between two businesses is allowed to go ahead.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that an initial investigation had found that the plan for Theramex to buy the European rights to two drugs could reduce competition.

Last year, the London-based women�s health company said it would buy the rights to Duphaston and Femoston HRT from US company Viatris.

Theramex is already one of the largest players in the UK�s market for �systemic� HRT. Systemic HRT drugs treat the whole body, rather than just a localised area.

It supplies oestrogen patches as well as oestrogen and progestogen patches and pills.

�The CMA is concerned that the deal could reduce competition in this important market, the cost of which is often covered by the NHS, by reducing incentives to bring new products to the market and improve and promote existing products,� the watchdog said.

�The reduction of HRT alternatives in a market that is already highly concentrated could reduce choice and also lead to potential price increases, as well as raising concerns about the security of supply.�

The companies have five days to respond to the concerns with �meaningful solutions� or risk facing a phase 2 investigation from the watchdog.

Inflation to fall to 1.2pc by June, says HSBC
Inflation in Britain will fall to 1.2pc in June, according to HSBC, before rising again before the end of the year.

The pace of price rises is expected to decline sharply as a result of the fall in the Ofgem price cap on energy bills in April, as well as from the passing of statistical �base effects,� the lender said.

Inflation has dropped from 11.1pc in October 2022 to 3.4pc in February as interest rates remain at 16-year highs of 5.25pc, squeezing businesses and consumers.

However, HSBC warned that wage growth and �sticky� inflation in the services sector threaten to increase inflation back above the Bank of England�s 2pc target.

It said inflation would reach �the target mark on a more �sustainable� basis next year�.

HSBC said: �To be clear, we do not see a re-acceleration in cost and price pressures ahead.

�But we are assuming a degree of persistence in our forecast such that, after the energy-driven dip this year, UK inflation will pop back slightly above 2pc later this year, before only reaching the target mark on a more �sustainable� basis next year.�

Chinese state-backed banks to determine fate of Thames Water
Two Chinese banks are to determine the fate of Thames Water as lenders await a crucial �190m payment.

Ben Marlow and Luke Barr have the details:

A consortium of lenders to Thames Water�s parent company Kemble is made up entirely of foreign banks, including the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China � both of which are owned and controlled by the Chinese state.

Dutch bank ING and Allied Irish Bank are also part of the creditor group.

The revelations will prompt fresh fears about Thames�s future amid concerns over China�s involvement in critical British infrastructure.

Last year the UK intervened eight times to block, reverse or impose conditions on takeovers that involved Chinese buyers under the National Security and Investment Act.

Wall Street poised to open higher after Powell�s rate cut reassurance
US stock indexes have gained in premarket trading after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said he still expects there to be three interest rate cuts in the US this year.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed higher on Wednesday after data showed the US services industry growth slowed further in March, strengthening the case for rate cuts.

Mr Powell did warn that rate cuts would happen only when policymakers �have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down� to the Fed�s 2pc target.

Stocks fell earlier in the week on the back of some strong economic reports, including manufacturing activity and job openings data that raised questions about the three rate cuts widely priced in for the year.

Money markets are currently seeing a near 59pc chance of at least a 25 basis point rate cut in June, according to the CME Group�s FedWatch tool.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rose 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 gained 0.4pc.

Oil nears $90 as supplies expected to shrink
Oil prices remain close to their five-month high after a rally brought the price of Brent crude close to $90 a barrel.

The Opec cartel of oil producing nations and its allies decided on Wednesday there would be no changes to its policy of cutting supplies over the course of this year.

Brent, the global crude benchmark, is up by about 16pc this year as the wars in Russia and the Middle East threaten supplies and as global economic recovery leads to an increase in consumption.

Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, said: �At the same time, the US demand outlook looks very healthy and broader supply disruptions from global events continue to add to the anxiety.�

Bosses expect prices to rise at slower pace, says Bank of England
British bosses expect inflation to decline over the next year and are forecasting their weakest price rises in two and a half years, according to a survey by the Bank of England.

Executives in March thought that prices rises over the next 12 months would fall to 3.2pc, down from 3.3pc in February, the Bank�s monthly decision maker panel showed.

Businesses expect to increase their own prices over the next year by 4.1pc, which is the lowest reading since October 2021, before the energy price shock caused by Vladimir Putin�s invasion of Ukraine.

The survey also found that firms expect their wage growth to decline by 1.5 percentage points over the next 12 months.

Over the next year, bosses expect the average interest rate on their borrowing to decline to 6.2pc from 7.1pc in March.

However, this still remains significantly higher than the interest rate of 3.6pc that companies had previously reported paying at the end of 2021.

Kiss sell music rights to Abba hologram show creators
US rock band Kiss have sold their music catalogue to the company behind Abba�s hologram concerts.

The group, known for their black and white make up and metallic outfits, have also allowed Pophouse Entertainment Group to buy its trademark and face paint designs.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and reported to be worth around $300m (�237m), includes master recordings and publishing rights to the band�s songs such as God Gave Rock �N� Roll To You II and Crazy Crazy Nights.

There are plans for a biopic and Kiss-themed experience following the sale.

The company, founded by Abba singer Bjorn Ulvaeus, previously made a deal with Kiss to turn the members of the band into avatars, similar to those in the Abba Voyage arena show concerts.

Kiss bassist Gene Simmons said:

We have always been breaking new ground in popular culture, and this partnership will ensure that we continue to do so for years to come because what Pophouse is doing is breaking rules.

We already have several plans in development, where the avatar show is one, a biopic another and a Kiss-themed experience a third. The future could not be more exciting.

Amazon has said it is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AWS cloud computing unit as part of a strategic shift.

The online retail giant said it is axing �a few hundred roles� in the team that oversees technology used in its physical stores, and follows the announcement that it is ending its use of its self-service checkout �just walk out� tech in grocery stores in the US.

The company said it is also cutting several hundred roles in the sales, marketing and global service teams at AWS.

�These decisions are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers,� AWS said in a statement.

It added that it will continue to hire in other, priority areas and that it has thousands of AWS job openings posted online.

The company has not said in which countries the layoffs will take place, but said it will also try to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are affected.

Thames Water owner�s credit rating cut amid �probable� default
The owner of Thames Water has had its credit rating cut to junk status as doubts grow about its ability to repay its debts.

Kemble Water had its senior secured debt rating downgraded to �CC� from �CCC� by Fitch Ratings after shareholders last week refused to provide a �500m cash injection to prevent the collapse of the troubled supplier.

As a result Kemble said that it will not be able to cover its upcoming interest payments or repay a �190m loan due at the end of this month.

Fitch said: �We believe that some form of default is probable and even if lenders agree to amend and extend (A&E) the upcoming loan, it is highly likely that the agreement would constitute a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under our criteria, which would trigger a downgrade of Kemble to �Restricted Default� (RD) on completion.�

A consortium of pension funds and foreign states last week announced they would stop funding Thames Water and accused Ofwat, the regulator, of rendering it �uninvestable�.

Demand for EVs slows sharply despite looming fines
The car industry has urged the Government to offer incentives to buy electric cars after new figures showed a decline in the market share of EVs.

Some 15.2pc of new cars registered in March were pure electrics, down from 16.2pc during the same month last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.

The industry body urged the Government to halve VAT on the purchase of new electric vehicles (EVs), amend plans to introduce vehicle excise duty for EVs, and reduce VAT on public EV charging to bring it into line with home charging.

Under the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, at least 22pc of new cars sold by each manufacturer in the UK this year must be zero-emission, which in most cases means they are pure electrics.

The threshold will rise annually until it reaches 100pc by 2035.

Manufacturers who fail to comply or make use of flexibilities - such as carrying over allowances from previous years or purchasing credits from rival companies - will be required to pay the Government �15,000 per polluting vehicle sold above the limits.

SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said:

Manufacturers are providing compelling offers, but they can�t single-handedly fund the transition indefinitely.

Government support for private consumers - not just business and fleets - would send a positive message and deliver a faster, fairer transition on time and on target.

Vodafone�s �15bn merger with Three to face in-depth competition investigation,"Vodafone�s �15bn mobile merger with Three will face an in-depth investigation over fears it could drive up prices for consumers.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed it has referred the deal to a detailed phase two investigation.

The regulator had said it was minded to launch the in-depth probe after raising concerns that the tie-up could lead to higher costs for consumers and affect investment in mobile networks.

It gave Vodafone and Three five working days to offer concessions to ease these concerns, but both companies declined to do so.

The watchdog now has until September 18 to carry out its in-depth review.

In a joint statement, the mobile firms said: �Vodafone UK and Three UK note today�s announcement that the CMA will conduct a Phase 2 review. As we�ve said, this was an expected next step in the process and is in line with the timeframe for completion that we set out from the outset.

�Vodafone UK and Three UK remain confident that the transaction will drive stronger competition in the mobile sector and give customers and businesses a step-change in network quality, speed, and coverage from day one.

�A combined network would also boost competition in the wholesale market, by offering greater choice to MVNOs [mobile virtual network operators], the fastest growing segment of the UK�s mobile industry.�

Vodafone and Three unveiled plans to merge last year in a deal that would create the UK�s largest mobile network with around 27 million customers.

It would also reduce the number of network operators in the country from four to three.

Consolidation in the telecoms market has previously faced opposition from regulators amid concerns it could push up consumer bills.

O2�s planned �10bn merger with Three in 2016 was blocked on competition grounds.

Vodafone and Three have argued that the market has changed significantly since then and that the deal is needed to give them the scale to compete with larger rivals EE, which is owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2.

They have pledged to invest �11bn in their combined 5G network once the deal has completed.

The CMA investigation is expected to examine risks that the merger will reduce rivalry between the two mobile companies to win customers.

The watchdog is also concerned the deal could make it more difficult for so-called �virtual� mobile operators such as Sky Mobile and Lebara, which piggyback off larger players� networks, to negotiate good deals for their customers as they will have fewer host networks to choose from.

Analysts expect Vodafone and Three to be asked to make concessions on mobile spectrum and to offer guarantees about existing network sharing agreements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed it will launch a so-called Phase 2 probe after both firms told the regulator they would not be offering measures to ease its concerns ahead of the deadline.

The telecoms giant last year agreed to merge with Three in a deal that will create the UK�s largest mobile network with more than 27 million customers.

However, the tie-up has attracted scrutiny due to concerns that Three�s Hong Kong-based parent company CK Hutchison could be granted access to sensitive national infrastructure.

The regulator said it found in its initial probe that the two companies are important alternatives for mobile customers and combining these two businesses will reduce rivalry between mobile operators to win new customers.

The watchdog also raised concerns that the deal �may make it difficult� for smaller mobile operators � such as Sky Mobile, Lebara and Lyca Mobile � to negotiate good deals for their own customers, by reducing the number of mobile network operators which will host them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone-Three merger faces further in-depth probe,"The planned �15 billion mega-merger of UK mobile networks Vodafone and Three is to face an in-depth investigation by the competition watchdog amid concerns over the impact of the deal.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed it will launch a so-called Phase 2 probe after both firms told the regulator they would not be offering measures to ease its concerns ahead of the deadline.

The CMA said last month that the tie-up could have a �substantial� impact on competition, warning it may lead to higher prices and reduced quality.

It gave the companies until April 2 to address its concerns.


Vodafone and Three first announced the mammoth merger last summer in a move that would create the UK�s largest mobile phone network.

Under the deal, FTSE 100-listed Vodafone and Three owner CK Hutchison will combine their UK operations, forming a business with about 27 million customers and more than 11,500 staff.

The merged firm will be majority owned by Vodafone with 51% of the combined business and CK Hutchison owning the remainder.

The two mobile firms have argued the deal will allow them to increase investment and better compete with major rivals, EE operator BT and Virgin Media-O2.

But the CMA launched an initial Phase 1 investigation into the move in January and said on March 22 that it has concerns over the impact of two of the UK�s four largest mobile firms merging.

The regulator said it found in its initial probe that the two companies are important alternatives for mobile customers and combining these two businesses will reduce rivalry between mobile operators to win new customers.

The watchdog also raised concerns that the deal �may make it difficult� for smaller mobile operators � such as Sky Mobile, Lebara and Lyca Mobile � to negotiate good deals for their own customers, by reducing the number of mobile network operators which will host them.

Vodafone flagged last month after the CMA gave its initial findings that it was preparing for a Phase 2 probe.

Experts said the two companies were not expected to put forward a package of measures to ease competition concerns by the April deadline that would allow the regulator to close its investigation.

Alex Haffner, competition partner at UK law firm Fladgate, said last month that the pair would �probably have to give up more ground at this stage than later on in the process�.

On the latest announcement by the CMA, Vodafone and Three said: �This was an expected next step in the process and is in line with the timeframe for completion that we set out from the outset.

�Vodafone UK and Three UK remain confident that the transaction will drive stronger competition in the mobile sector and give customers and businesses a step-change in network quality, speed, and coverage from day one.�

They added: �We will review the potential concerns raised by the CMA and look forward to continuing to engage constructively with them throughout the review.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone-Three $19B merger targeted by UK regulator for in-depth antitrust probe,"(Reuters) � Britain's competition regulator said on Thursday it would need to open an in-depth investigation into the merger between Vodafone's UK operation and Hutchison's Three UK after the parties did not offer remedies to ease the regulator's competition concerns.

The $19 billion tie-up, which was announced last year, will reduce the number of networks from four to three, challenging the long-held tenet that four help keep prices low.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last month the deal risked leaving consumers worse off and asked the companies to respond with ""meaningful solutions"" to its concerns that the merger will result in higher prices for consumers and businesses and lower investment.

""On 28 March 2024, the Parties informed the CMA that they would not be offering any undertakings,"" the regulator said in a statement on Thursday.

12 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets According to Analysts,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best stocks to buy in falling markets according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of bear markets and the broader stock market, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets According to Analysts.

With the first quarter of 2024 ending, it appears that investors have finally settled on a valuation of artificial intelligence and its impact on the broader semiconductor industry. The Wall Street of 2024 is dealing with moderately high single digit interest rates, which have now become the new status quo as the Federal Reserve maintains a cautious outlook for inflation. The stock market has also been helped by the fact that the U.S. economy posted triple single digit percentage economic growth in 2023, despite many Americans finding it difficult to maintain spending amidst higher rates and higher prices of essential items.

When it comes to trading stocks, firms that sell these essential items are called consumer staples or consumer defensive, and within a broader bear market, they often provide investors with stability. However, in today's stock market, enterprise computing has taken over personal computing as one of the highest growth sectors due to investor sentiments about the shift to advanced data analysis techniques such as artificial intelligence.

Consequently, the flagship S&P 500 index is up by 31% over the past 12 months, and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite is up even higher by having posted 38% in returns. No one can call this a bear market, and to look for such stocks, one has to further dive into different sectors to see whether any secular trends are affecting the share prices of multiple firms.

For instance, even though the broader stock markets are up in green over the past year or so, one sector that can rightfully be said to be in a bear market is renewable energy. Before the coronavirus pandemic, it was one of the hottest sectors on the market as investors benefited from 'easy money' and consumers could splurge on products such as heavy duty residential solar power systems and electric vehicles.

However, over the past 12 months, the S&P Global Clean Energy Index is down by a painful 26%, with multiple crises in the global lithium industry and the interest rate environment. In fact, the sensitive nature of these bear market stocks when it comes to interest rates was apparent in February 2024 when investors were greeted with the first set of inflation data for 2024. These figures were for January, and they saw prices rise 3.1% annually and overshoot analyst estimates of 2.9%. January's inflation figures, just like December's saw stocks drop and this time around the drops ensured that stocks such as SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ:SPWR) and ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) remained bear market stocks.

Apart from utilities, other stocks are also suffering from falling markets. One such example is the utility industry, with the S&P 500 Utilities and Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index indexes down by 4.07% and 3.91% respectively over the past 12 months. Their drops are overshadowed by the telecommunications sector, which is yet to overcome weakness stemming from multiple factors such as high debt load and exposure to lead cables. Consequently, the S&P Telecom Select Industry Index has shed 6.78% over the past 12 months, making it yet another falling market.

One telecommunications firm whose shares have taken a beating recently is AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T). Its shares sank by 16% during the first two and a half weeks of July 2023 after reports that AT&T faced significant exposure from having used lead cables. This led JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) to cut the stock's rating to Neutral from Overweight and reduce the share price target by $5.

Since Insider Monkey focuses primarily on hedge fund data, we thought to take a look at what hedge fund sentiment was about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) back in 2023. Here's what Miller Value Partners shared about the falling market stock in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T (T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash ow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash ow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash ow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a �2,� suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.

With these details in mind, let's take a look at some stocks in falling markets that analysts are optimistic about. A couple of notable picks are Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN), and Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA).

"Vodafone Germany to cut 2,000 jobs in revamp","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Vodafone Germany aims to save around 400 million euros ($434.48 million) over the next two years as part of a restructuring that will hit some 2,000 jobs, the company said on Tuesday.

The move is part of a cost-cutting drive announced nearly a year ago which will result in the loss of some 11,000 jobs worldwide.

""Personnel costs will be reduced through savings and the relocation of around 2,000 jobs - also because manual tasks will be performed by increased automation in future,"" it said.

A large part of the savings will be come from switching off and updating outdated IT structures, said the company, a unit of British telecoms giant Vodafone.

However, investment in high-growth areas such as the cloud and corporate client business will be strengthened, it said.

The mobile phone group expanded across Europe in the first decade of the century, but has struggled in Spain and Italy and has agreed to sell its Italian operation to Swisscom.

Earlier this month, Vodafone said it would replace its boss in its largest market of Germany, Philippe Rogge, with Vodafone UK's Ahmed Essam in a new role of Executive Chairman Germany and Chief Executive European Markets.

Wetherspoon's reported that like-for-like sales grew by 9.9% in the 26 weeks to 28 January. But growth since the end of January has slowed, with like-for-like sales up 5.8% in the last seven weeks.

Chairman Tim Martin said: �The company continues to be concerned about the possibility of further lockdowns and about the efficacy of the government enquiry into the pandemic, which will not be concluded for several years.�

That may see the return of dividends kicked further down the road.

�Location is key and recent openings include the Stargazer at the old Millenium Dome in Greenwich and the Star Light at Heathrow Airport. Overall, returning the estate to growth could be a welcome development. But there�s only so much you can grow if pub numbers remain static, and for now like-for-like growth has taken a step down. 5.8% isn�t awful but if it stays at this level for the rest of the year the market�s likely to be disappointed.�

Vodafone (VOD.L)
The proposed merger between mobile networks Vodafone and Three could lead to �customers facing higher prices and reduced quality�, the UK's competition watchdog has warned.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal will now face an in-depth investigation unless both companies can soon address their worries.

Vodafone and Three first announced the �15bn merger last summer. It would create the UK�s largest mobile phone network.

The two mobile firms have argued the deal will allow them to increase investment and better compete with major rivals, EE operator BT and Virgin Media-O2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Three�s merger with Vodafone risks driving up prices, warns regulator","The �15bn merger between Vodafone and Three risks pushing up prices for millions of mobile customers, regulators have warned.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is preparing to launch an in-depth investigation after highlighting concerns that the deal could lead to higher costs for consumers and affect investment in mobile networks.

The companies have five working days to respond with remedies to resolve the CMA�s concerns. If they cannot satisfy the watchdog then the deal will move to a phase two investigation, which is expected to last six months.

Vodafone and Three announced plans to merge last year in a tie-up that will create the UK�s largest mobile network with around 27 million customers.

It will also reduce the number of network operators in the country from four to three.

The CMA said its initial investigation had identified the risk that merging the two companies would reduce rivalry between mobile operators to win customers.

The watchdog is also concerned the deal could make it more difficult for so-called �virtual� mobile operators such as Sky Mobile and Lebara, which piggyback off larger players� networks, to negotiate good deals for their customers as they will have fewer host networks to choose from.

Vodafone and Three have argued that the tie-up is needed to give them the scale to compete with larger rivals EE, which is owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2.

They have pledged to invest �11bn in their combined 5G network once the deal has completed.

Three yesterday revealed it had posted its first loss in 13 years in 2023 and warned its finances were unsustainable without the merger.

However, the CMA cast doubt on these claims, saying its initial review had found both companies were currently viable and competitive and would continue to invest in their networks regardless.


It said this needed further assessment, particularly given concerns that the merger would reduce overall incentive to invest.
Julie Bon, the CMA�s phase one decisionmaker for the case, said: �Millions of people in the UK depend on effective competition in the mobile market in order to access the best deals for them.

�Whilst Vodafone and Three have made a number of claims about how their deal is good for competition and investment, the CMA has not seen sufficient evidence to date to back these claims.

�Our initial assessment of this deal has identified concerns which could lead to higher prices for customers and lower investment in UK mobile networks. These warrant an in-depth investigation unless Vodafone and Three can come forward with solutions.�

Vodafone and Three said the findings were the expected next step in the regulatory process and remained confident the deal would bring benefits for consumers.

Ahmed Essam, Vodafone�s UK chief executive, said: �Having reached this important milestone, we look forward to working with the independent panel on the Phase 2 process.

�By merging our two companies, we will be able to invest �11bn to help the UK realise its ambitions to be a world leader in next-generation 5G technology, and increase competition across the industry.

�This transaction will create an operator with the scale required to take on BT/EE and VMO2, give MVNOs greater choice in the wholesale market and is in the wider interests of customers, competition and the country.�.

Robert Finnegan, chief executive of Three, said: �The current market structure is holding the UK back, which is not good for customers or competition.

�By creating a third player with the necessary scale to invest, the combination of our two companies will deliver one of Europe�s most advanced networks and move the UK into the digital fast lane, benefiting customers from day one.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulator said it found in its initial probe that the two companies are important alternatives for mobile customers and combining these two businesses will reduce rivalry between mobile operators to win new customers.

Baby formula lawsuit wipes �7bn off FTSE 100 giant,"Consumer goods giant Reckitt has suffered a �7bn share price slump after it lost a US legal case claiming its baby formula contributed to the death of a premature child.

London-listed Reckitt�s share price plunged by the most in two decades and to its lowest point in more than a decade after an Illinois jury ruled Reckitt had failed to warn about the risks of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) from its milk-based Enfamil brand products.

NEC is an illness that damages the stomach and tends to affect premature babies. Reckitt�s US subsidiary Mead Johnson Nutrition had been sued by Jasmine Watson, who claimed the baby formula caused the death of her premature baby.

FTSE 100-constituent Reckitt has now been ordered to pay Ms Watson $60m (�47m) after losing the case.

Ashley Keller, a lawyer for Ms Watson, said: �The jury�s finding confirms what Mead Johnson folks already knew � that its formula dramatically increases the NEC risk. �This is the first verdict in the US, but won�t be the last, unless baby formula makers accept responsibility for their misdeeds.�

News of the decision sparked a near 20pc plunge in Reckitt�s share price, wiping around �7.3bn ($9.3bn) from its market value.

It comes amid hundreds of US lawsuits against formula makers over NEC. The Illinois case was the first to go to a jury trial.

Shares in Abbott Laboratories, another formula maker facing legal claims, fell almost 5pc. Jurors took less than two hours to decide that Mead Johnson should pay $60m in compensatory damages. Mr Keller said: �We only asked for $25m, but the jury came back with more than double that.�

More than 400 suits targeting Mead Johnson and Abbott are consolidated before a federal judge in Chicago for pre-trial information exchanges. The judge hasn�t yet scheduled a trial. Thousands of other suits are pending in state courts, Mr Keller said. Reckitt continues to insist its products are safe and not linked to NEC. It has vowed to appeal the Illinois case.

NEC has a fatality rate of as much as 40pc. It is a major cause of death among premature babies, though rarely occurs in full-term babies.

The disease, which affects intestinal tissues, can be hard to diagnose. According to the NHS, symptoms can include general signs of illness, problems feeding or vomiting, and a swollen and tender abdomen.

While it has a high fatality rate, it can be treated with intravenous feeding and antibiotics. In some cases it can require surgery.

Reckitt said in a stock market update that it stands by the safety of its products and �strongly rejects any assertion that any of our products cause NEC�.

The company added: �It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.

�This case, and others like it, exclusively involve products used under the strict supervision of neonatologists in neonatal intensive care units and provide lifesaving nutrition options for vulnerable premature infants.

�We are, of course, surprised and deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned.�

Reckitt is one of the world�s largest consumer goods companies, pulling in revenues of �14.6bn in 2023. As well as Enfamil, it makes products such as Durex condoms, Cillit Bang cleaning fluid and Gaviscon.

Nutrition brands account for about 16pc of its sales, contributing �2.4bn to its turnover last year.

News of the Illinois jury�s decision marks the latest in a series of blows for the company, which last month revealed a �55m hit to revenues caused by an accounting controversy in the Middle East.

Kris Licht, chief executive at Reckitt, said the company had unearthed �some commercial practices that we weren�t particularly pleased with�, leading to the dismissal of a number of employees.

Reckitt in January recalled two baby formula products from sale in the UK amid concerns they could contain dangerous bacteria, in an event unrelated to the case in the US.

Adobe drops 14pc amid fears of competition from AI rivals
Adobe has dropped 14pc in trading today after it forecast revenue for the current quarter below analysts� estimates, amid concerns of rising competition from AI-focused startups for its photography, illustration and video software.

�Expectations were perhaps a little higher in terms of what we would guide,� chief executive Shantanu Narayen said during a conference call after the results, according to a Bloomberg report. �But you know I�m really optimistic about what we�ve done,� he said of the software giant�s AI initiatives.

Revenue will be $5.25bn to $5.3bn (�4.12 to �4.16bn) in the quarter, below the $5.1bn that analysts had forecast.

Stuttering growth could cause Europe to cut rates before America
Wall Street�s main stock indexes are down today after a slew of data this week dampened hopes for several rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year.

Shares in Paris and Frankfurt ended little changed Friday but rose during the course of the week.

The shares gained on expectations that Europe�s stuttering growth might enable the ECB to start cutting interest rates this summer, even if the Fed doesn�t.

Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics, said �the ECB doesn�t need to wait for the Fed,� and added that the Norwegian and Swiss central banks could cut rates in the coming weeks.

Even though neither country uses the euro, their moves would underscore that European monetary policy doesn�t have to take its cue from the Fed.

Meanwhile, in the US, a sharper-than-expected jump in US wholesale prices sent US shares lower on Thursday and those inflation concerns carried over into Friday.

Rolls-Royce to add 200 jobs in Derby as engines prove a hit
Rolls-Royce is to expand its engine manufacturing capacity in the UK and Germany amid booming demand for overseas travel. Matt Oliver reports:

The British engineering giant on Friday said it would increase its assembly, testing and shop capacity, to meet demand for its large engines and improve maintenance for those already in service.

Over the rest of this decade, the company predicts the number of aircraft using its Trent family of turbofan engines to grow by as much as 9pc annually.

As a result, Rolls is investing �55m and hiring 300 frontline workers to boost its operations in Derby and Dahlewitz, in Germany.

About half of the investment and two thirds of the jobs will go to Derby, the company said.

It will be used to expand the number of engines the company�s factory there can deliver per year by 40pc from 2025, while also increasing the number of engines that can undergo maintenance.

Meanwhile, Rolls will take advantage of existing engine testing capabilities in Dahlewitz to temporarily meet extra maintenance demands before switching to assemble and test new Trent XWB-84 engines from 2026.

It comes after the company vowed to invest �1bn in improvements to the Trent engine family.

Last month Rolls revealed sales of its large aeroplane engines had surged to their highest level in 15 years.

BP among winners in North East gas-fired power station push
Major plans for gas-fired power stations that capture carbon took a key step forward today with the award of building contracts worth �4bn.

The joint-venture scheme, led by British energy giant BP plus France�s TotalEnergies and Norway�s Equinor, forms part of the Government plans for a net zero carbon economy by 2050.

The facilities, to be built in northern England by a date yet to be specified, come under the Net Zero Teesside Power and Northern Endurance Partnership banners.

The pair on Friday said they had �selected contractors for engineering, procurement, and construction contracts with a combined value of around �4bn�. They added:

The selection of nine leading specialist contractors ... is a major milestone for the Teesside-based projects, which would contribute to the UK�s journey towards net zero emissions by 2050.

Up to two million tonnes of CO2 would be captured annually before being transported and securely stored in subsea sites beneath the North Sea.

Companies awarded contracts included energy group Shell and infrastructure specialists Balfour Beatty.

Friday�s announcement comes after Rishi Sunak�s administration this week pledged to build new gas-fired power stations to boost energy security.

At the same time, the UK is rolling out low-carbon energies such as nuclear, solar and wind power in a strategy to combat sky-high domestic electricity and gas bills, which rocketed after key producer Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.

Reckitt Benckiser plunges after infant formula verdict
Dettol maker Reckitt Benckiser has fallen 17pc this afternoon. It followed an Illinois jury ordering the company�s Mead Johnson division to pay $60m (�47m) to the mother of a premature baby who died of an intestinal disease after being fed the company�s Enfamil baby formula.

Shares plunged on fears that the consumer goods company would face more financial liabilities from lawsuits related to the baby formula.

Reckitt told investors that it strongly disagreed with the jury�s decision.

It said:

We continue to believe that the allegations from the plaintiff�s lawyers in this case were not supported by the science or experts in the medical community � It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.

Reckitt added that it was �deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned�.

Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

It�s not simply the size of this payout which has caused nervousness, but the fact a long line of other lawsuits are pending, which could mount up to be a huge sum for the company.

Activist investor Oasis builds stake in Britain�s biggest sandwich maker
A Hong Kong-based activist investor has built up shares in Britain�s biggest sandwich maker after its share price fell by almost 50pc in the last five years. Daniel Woolfson reports:

Oasis Management has acquired almost 5pc of the shares in Greencore, a major supplier of sandwiches and ready meals to the UK�s major supermarkets.

Greencore produces 779m sandwiches a year and supplies Sainsbury�s, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.

As well as sandwiches, it makes sushi, soups, packaged ready-meals and other chilled supermarket products. It employs around 13,600 people across the UK.

Its shares have been languishing since the pandemic, falling more than 45pc over the last five years.

Oasis has waged shareholder campaigns at a number of prominent consumer companies over recent years.

A stake of almost 5pc of the company would make Oasis one of Greencore�s largest shareholders. It is understood that Oasis plans to continue buying shares. Once its stake rises above 5pc, it will be required to make a formal disclosure.

Oasis�s European boss, Daniel Wosner, is understood to have met with executives at Greencore, the Financial Times, which first reported the news, said.

Thames Water�s lenders hire advisors before �190m debt deadline
Lenders to Thames Water�s parent company have reportedly hired advisers weeks before a �190m debt becomes due.

Sky News says a syndicate of financiers have hired accountancy firm EY, amid concerns from regulators and politicians about the water company�s ability to survive.

In December, Thames Water admitted to MPs that the holding company did not �currently� have the money to make the repayment due in April.

Chris Weston, the newly appointed boss of Thames Water, has vowed to �restore confidence� in the business.

He said:

I recognise that this business is critical to both society and the UK and how important it is that we restore confidence in our operations and financial position.

Thames Water declined to comment.

Next set to deliver higher profits despite cost of living pressures
Next is set to reveal higher profits for the past year as investors hope the clothing chain continues to shrug off customers� cost-of-living pressures.

The retailer has already upgraded its profit outlook five times over the past year as it has outperformed rivals amid a challenging economic backdrop.

Shares in the company are trading at close to record highs as a result.

The retailer is expected to reveal a 4pc increase in pre-tax profits to �905m for the year to January, in its latest update on Thursday next week.

The group is also expected to reveal full-year sales growth of about 4pc against the previous year, taking sales to about �4.78bn.

Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

Next gave investors plenty to be happy about in their last update, with growth of 9.1pc in its online channel helping sales to exceed group forecasts.

While it may be winning the online race, the retail sector remains a tough place to operate.

And with a history of under-promising and over-delivering, markets have come to have high expectations.

Americans slightly less optimistic about the economy - but believe inflation will cool
American consumers have become slightly less optimistic about the world�s largest economy this month, although they continue to expect inflation to cool further.

The University of Michigan�s consumer sentiment index, slipped to 76.5 in March according to preliminary figures, barely below February�s figure of 76.9. Americans� outlook has essentially remained fixed since January, when it leapt higher.

The consumer sentiment figure follows inflation reports this week that showed that, for a second straight month, prices rose at a pace faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve�s 2pc target.

The consumer price index rose 3.2pc in February compared with a year ago, up from 3.1pc in January.

Yet the University of Michigan report showed that Americans� outlook for inflation hasn�t changed this month compared with February. Consumers expect inflation over the next year to be 3pc, the same as in the previous month.

US manufacturing and mining rebound as weather improves
US industrial production ticked higher in February as an improvement in the weather helped boost manufacturing and mining, the Federal Reserve said, although earlier data was revised lower.

Production rose 0.1pc in February following a revised fall of 0.5pc in January, the Fed announced.

This was slightly above market expectations of no monthly change, but given the sharp downward revision for both December and January, the index remains lower than it was a year ago.

Much of February�s rise was down to a 0.8pc rise in manufacturing output, and a 2.2pc increase in the index for mining.

�Both gains partly reflected recoveries from weather-related declines in January,� the Fed said, adding that the �warmer-than-typical� month also helped push down the utilities index.

High Frequency Economics� chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi said: �Overall industrial production was slightly better than expected and manufacturing surprised to the upside in February.�

She added that the manufacturing sector �continues to face headwinds from higher borrowing costs and tighter credit conditions.�

Rail workers prepare to go on strike
Contract workers at Northern Rail will strike on Saturday in a dispute over pay, union recognition and working conditions.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) employed by Carlisle Support Services will mount picket lines in Manchester, Leeds and Wigan.

About 150 workers are involved in the dispute, including ticket barrier staff.

RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said:

Our members are once again taking strike action against a company who has shown no regard for their staff and is not willing to settle this dispute.

We will continue our industrial campaign until we can reach a negotiated settlement.

Ultimately, the only, long-term solution is to end contracting out and bring the gateline contract back in house with all the benefits of direct employment from Northern.

JD.com passes up on chance to buy Currys
JD.com said that �following careful consideration, it does not intend to make an offer for Currys�.

Representatives from the Chinese online shopping empire had made contact with the British retailer�s board and held exploratory talks in recent weeks but never made a formal offer.

The discussions came as China�s biggest retailer seeks new sources of growth amid a sharp consumer slowdown at home.

However, the Currys board indicated it was not prepared to be taken private at a discount, after rejecting two bids from US investor Elliott Management.

The electricals retailer�s largest shareholder warned that more foreign corporates will start circling London companies.

Redwheel, which holds 14.6pc of shares in Currys, said it was in �complete agreement� with the company�s board over their decision to reject a takeover offer from US hedge fund Elliott.

Wall Street shares sink over $5.3 trillion trading quirk
Shares sank on Wall Street today as a $5.3 trillion trading quirk triggered a sudden price swing.

The Dow Jones was last down 0.4pc, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.6pc and the Nasdaq Composition has dropped 1.1pc as derivatives traders en masse face decisions about contracts that are scheduled to mature.

Traders are forced to either roll over their positions or open new ones, but with $5.3 trillion of contracts scheduled to expire today it will trigger sharp changes in markets.

The quarterly phenomenon affecting trades tied to stocks, index options and futures is known as �triple witching�.

Rocky Fishman, founder of derivatives analytical firm Asym 500, said:

It�s a day in which the direction of the market is very, very difficult to predict.

On these big expiration days, the �internals� get so skewed by the expiration that they don�t tell us anything.

Therefore, it will be important that investors don�t use today�s action when trying to decipher what is going to happen in the marketplace next week and beyond.

UK council wins �400m payout from Apple
An English council has won a $490m (�384m) legal victory against Apple over claims the tech giant exaggerated demand for its iPhones.

Our technology editor James Titcomb has the details:

Apple has agreed to pay shareholders the sum after settling with Norfolk County Council, which led a class action lawsuit against the company.

The settlement comes after a five-year lawsuit claiming Apple�s chief executive Tim Cook had misled shareholders by neglecting to identify a downturn in demand in China weeks before a dramatic profit warning in 2019.

The case was originally brought against Apple, Mr Cook, and chief financial officer Luca Maestri by the US city of Roseville.

Norfolk Council, which administers the �4.9bn Norfolk Pension Fund, took over the lawsuit as lead plaintiff in 2020.

Britain to import energy from US under plan for transatlantic power cable
Britain homes could one day be powered by electricity generated in America under plans to install up to six power cables across the Atlantic.

Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the details:

The cables would stretch roughly 3,500 miles across the ocean, reaching depths of up to 11,000 feet, and carrying power roughly equivalent to several nuclear power stations.

A group of London investors and energy consultants are behind the ambitions scheme, as they claim technological advances in subsea cables could allow the creation of a global �intercontinental grid�.

Simon Ludlam, one of the businessmen backing the project, says such a cable would enable electricity to be traded across the Atlantic, taking advantage of the differences in peak demand as the power line crosses time zones.

This graphic shows how transatlantic power sharing works.

US markets muted ahead of opening bell
The main US stock indexes were subdued in premarket trading after hotter-than-expected consumer prices and producer prices data.

Wall Street was set to end slightly higher this week in spite of figures pointing to sticky inflation, which had sent the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond to a two-week high.

Higher inflation adds pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates elevated, pushing traders to rein in bets of a June rate cut to 60pc from 73pc last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve�s meeting next week for hints on the timing of the central bank�s rate-easing cycle.

Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank�s global head of economics and thematic research, said: �At the Fed, the big question next week is what they�ll signal in their new dot plot, and whether the median dot still points towards three cuts for 2024, as happened in December.�

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewas up 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 was down 0.2pc.

Rail union threatens strike action
A rail union is warning of possible industrial action against one of the country�s biggest train operators in a dispute over working arrangements for control room staff.

The Transport Salaried Staffs� Association (TSSA) said strikes could be held by its members at South Western Railway (SWR) after the two sides failed to resolve a row over the �imposition� of changed working arrangements.

The union has now served notice of the first stage of an official process which it warned could lead to industrial action.

Gareth Theobald, TSSA organiser for SWR, said:

This isn�t merely a shift in working patterns, it�s a stark deviation from well-established norms and we urge SWR to return to the negotiating table without delay to resolve this issue.

It�s vital that the company understand the seriousness of the situation. We want to avoid industrial action and ensure the continued provision of rail services to the public.

However, SWR should be in no doubt that if staff need to take action, then trains will come to a stop.

Pound on track for worst week in three months
The pound was set for its biggest weekly fall against the dollar since December, as investors became less certain about summer interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve amid stronger-than-anticipated inflation figures.

The slide in sterling comes after a period of relative strength for the currency, which has gained this year on bets the Bank of England will keep rates higher for longer than its peers.

However, the pound has been impacted by doubts over the Fed�s plans for its first rate cut, with traders now rating the chances of 54.7pc in June, down from 67pc before the data showed stronger-than-expected producer price inflation.

Sterling was last broadly flat versus the dollar on the day at $1.27 but was on track for a 1pc weekly fall. The euro gained 0.1pc versus the pound to 85p.

The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold at 5.25pc next Thursday, with market pricing favouring the Bank of England cutting rates slightly slower than the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve this year.

Inflation expectations fall to lowest level since Russia�s invasion of Ukraine
The British public�s expectations for where inflation will be in a year�s time has fallen to its lowest level in three years amid hopes that interest rates will be cut this summer.

The Bank of England�s inflation attitudes survey found that the average expectation of what the rate of inflation will be over the coming year was 3pc, down from 3.3pc in November last year.

This was the lowest level since August 2021, before Vladimir Putin�s decision to invade Ukraine, triggering an energy inflation crisis across the globe.

It comes as Russia holds national elections which Ukrainian defence intelligence (DIU) said would see Moscow mark ballot papers with the names of dead, missing and captured soldiers in order to boost Putin�s support.

BT investor agrees sale of part of French media empire
French shipping company CMA CGM has agreed to buy part of the media business owned by French billionaire Patrick Drahi, who holds a nearly 25pc stake in BT.

CMA CGM�s chief executive Rodolphe Saade intends to create a large media conglomerate in France following the purchase of Altice Media, which owns leading French news channel BFM TV.

Altice�s founder and owner Patrick Drahi said the deal would allow further investments into the group�s media such as BFM TV station and RMC radio station.

The sales comes after the BT investor said last year that he �feels betrayed� over an alleged corruption scandal within his telecoms empire that triggered the arrest of his right-hand man.

The French billionaire said that he was �shocked� after Portuguese authorities launched a criminal investigation into alleged corruption by individuals and senior executives within his sprawling media and telecoms group.

BFM is France�s leading TV news channel, and says it has 12 million daily viewers.

McDonald�s forced to close restaurants amid IT chaos
McDonald�s has apologised after it suffered an IT system outage in its British restaurants, which forced the closure of some sites and left customers unable to order food.

The fast food giant insisted it was not hit by a cyber attack after consumers took to social media to complain of issues in several countries including the UK, Japan, China, Sweden and Australia.

The Japanese arm of the chain apologised to customers on social media, telling them that they would have to �wait a while� amid the issues.

�Many stores across the country have temporarily suspended operations. We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers,� it posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

People in Australia, meanwhile, posted pictures of closed restaurants and signs alerting diners that McDonald�s could not accept orders.

The cause of the outages is unknown, but it appears to be linked to the chain�s IT systems.

Some stores were reported to be operating but only able to take cash orders.

A McDonald�s spokesman said: �We are aware of a technology outage which impacted our restaurants. The issue has now been resolved in the UK and Ireland.

�We thank customers for their patience and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. The issue is not related to a cybersecurity event.�

EXPLAINER-Why European telecoms are consolidating,"STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Reuters) - Swisscom's agreement to buy Vodafone Italia for 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) is the latest attempt by a European telecom company to boost its prospects through consolidation, divesting assets, or selling stakes to investors.

Weighed down by billions of euros of debt, European telecom companies operate in small, highly competitive markets, unlike their peers in other regions, making it difficult for them to find growth.

The following outlines their limited options.

CONSOLIDATION

European telcos have for years fought regulatory hurdles that prevent mergers.

Many countries have four mobile operators jostling for share in small markets, which usually equates to lower prices for consumers but less profit for the companies, analysts say.

Mergers would reduce the number of operators, and regulators are concerned that could lead to higher prices, less choice and lower quality for consumers, particularly if two local players join forces in one market.

The Swisscom and Vodafone deal would create Italy's second-biggest fixed-line broadband operator behind Telecom Italia (TIM).

Bouygues Telecom, a unit of French conglomerate Bouygues , last month signed an exclusivity agreement with La Poste to buy its telecoms unit for 950 million euros ($1.03 billion). If finalised, the deal would reduce competition in the French market.

Earlier this week, Spain's government authorised an 18.6 billion euro merger between French mobile operator Orange's Spanish business and its rival MasMovil.

The deal, which received EU antitrust clearance in February, has been viewed in the sector as a test case of whether Europe's antitrust regulators have become more lenient in approving deals that reduce the number of operators.

Analyst Paolo Pescatore at PP Foresight told Reuters they arguably had not. He said the complementary nature of both businesses meant Swisscom-Vodafone had a greater chance of getting clearance, while the Orange-Masmovil deal was only approved on the condition that a stronger player would emerge in the mobile network market.

Britain's antitrust watchdog in January launched an investigation into the $19 billion merger between Vodafone's UK operation and CK Hutchison's. It is due to provide an update later in March.

SELLING ASSETS

In the last few years, telecom firms have sold non-core assets such as mobile tower businesses to raise cash.

American Tower and Cellnex spent billions of dollars in buying up the mobile masts. Spain's Telefonica received 7.7 billion euros for selling its towers business.

Companies are now trying to shed businesses closer to their main operations.

Vodafone, the third telecom player in Spain after Telefonica and Orange, is set to sell its Spanish business to London-listed Zegona Communications for 5 billion euros.

Former phone monopoly Telecom Italia (TIM) is selling its fixed-line network to U.S. fund KKR in a deal worth up to 22 billion euros.

FOREIGN FIRMS BUY STAKES, GOVERNMENTS SCRUTINISE

European telecoms' struggles have given Middle Eastern telecom companies an opportunity to build presence in the region.

Between Saudi telecoms group STC and UAE�s e&, they have spent over 5 billion euros in four deals in Europe in the last year.

Some governments have increased their stakes in telecom companies to offset growing foreign ownership.

In response to STC announcing in September it had built up a 9.9% interest in Telefonica, Spain's government in December said it would acquire up to 10% through the state holding company SEPI.

Britain said in January it had put in place ""proportionate measures"" to alleviate its national security concerns about the relationship between Vodafone and Abu Dhabi-based telecoms group e&, having earlier cleared the state-controlled company's 14.6% stake in Vodafone.

"Vodafone Wraps Overhaul With �8 Billion Italy Deal, Buyback","Vodafone Group Plc struck an �8 billion ($8.7 billion) deal to sell its Italian business to Swisscom AG, bringing to a close a years-long divestment effort and setting the stage for a shake-up of the fiercely competitive Italian market.

Swisscom will merge Vodafone Italia with its Fastweb SpA subsidiary, and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, the companies said in a statement Friday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg report.

Chief Executive Officer Margherita Della Valle, who formally took the reigns last year, has sold off underperforming markets and worked to scale back a sprawling empire that at one point stretched from the US to Africa. Europe�s telecom carriers have struggled in recent years with heavy competition and regulation, which have hurt returns and inspired more dealmaking.

Combined with Vodafone�s recent Spanish unit sale, the company said it will get about �12 billion in cash and plans to buy back �4 billion in stock. The company also said it would cut its dividend in half to 4.5 cents per share beginning in fiscal 2025.

Vodafone shares rose 4.8% to 69.28 pence in London trading at 2:15 p.m. Swisscom rose 4.6% to 527 Swiss francs in Zurich.

The deal may challenge former phone monopoly Telecom Italia SpA, which recently sold off its landline network and is struggling to convince investors of its growth potential. Combined, Fastweb and Vodafone Italia will be a formidable competitor for enterprise services, one of the few segments growing in Italy and a key source of revenue for Telecom Italia.

A transaction is also unlikely to improve competition in the mobile market, according to Claudio Campanini, Europe head for telecommunications, media and technology at Kearney. French billionaire Xavier Niel�s Iliad SA, which helped spark and Italian price war when it entered the market in 2018, had also tried to buy the Vodafone business and was rebuffed.

The deal will �have a small impact on competitive dynamics for fixed line services and basically zero impact for mobile services,� Campanini said in an interview. �If you want to really change Italy�s telecom industry, you need to consolidate Iliad.�

Della Valle called the sale the �final step in the reshaping of our European operations,� in the statement. �Our businesses will be operating in growing telco markets - where we hold strong positions - enabling us to deliver predictable, stronger growth in Europe.�

She had agreed to sell Vodafone Spain in October and is planning to merge the company�s UK business with CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. That leaves Vodafone with three major markets: Germany, Africa and the rest of Europe, Della Valle said in a call with reporters on Friday.

Under the company�s buyback plan, Vodafone will repurchase about �2 billion in shares this year after the Spanish deal closes and another �2 billion once the Italian transaction is wrapped up.

�One thing that is certain is that Margherita Della Valle has delivered on the deal front having taken over as CEO less than a year ago,� Enders Analysis analyst Karen Egan said in a note on Friday. �If she can deliver on a change in structure and culture to the benefit of the operational performance as convincingly as she has done with dealmaking, then the Vodafone story really could start a very promising new chapter.�

Evercore Inc. served as lead financial adviser to Swisscom, which is also working with Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Deutsche Bank, ING Groep NV and UniCredit SpA are lead underwriters of the debt financing. UBS Group AG was sole financial adviser to Vodafone.

Britain's Vodafone confirms sale of Italian arm to Swisscom for $8.7 billion,"LONDON (AP) � British cellphone company Vodafone confirmed Friday that it is selling its Italian business to Switzerland�s Swisscom for 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) and will hand back half of the proceeds to its shareholders through the buyback of company shares.

Vodafone said the move, with talks first announced Feb. 28, represented an �attractive valuation� and marked the final step of its strategy to sell off parts of its European portfolio.

Swisscom, a telecoms operator, will pay in cash that it will finance through new debt. It is aiming to merge its acquisition with Fastweb, the company's subsidiary in Italy. It said the deal will help it unlock 600 million euros in savings and will enable the combined entity to sustain investments and offer improved services.

�The industrial logic of this merger is very strong,� Swisscom CEO Christoph Aeschlimann said. ""Fastweb and Vodafone Italia are an ideal fit to create high added value for all stakeholders.""

As part of the deal, which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025, the two firms agreed that Vodafone will continue to provide �certain services� to Swisscom over the next five years. Swisscom will pay annual initial charges of 350 million euros, which is expected to decrease over time.

Vodafone added that the two companies also are �exploring a closer commercial relationship to enable collaboration across a broad range of areas, beyond Italy.""

Vodafone Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said the sale �creates significant value for Vodafone and ensures the business maintains its leading position in Italy.�

Vodafone has been looking to free up cash and improve its financial performance by selling off parts of the business, including its Spanish arm, having previously struck deals to sell its divisions in Hungary and Ghana.

The markets appeared to welcome the deal, with Vodafone's shares closing 5.7% higher in London and Swisscom's ending 4.9% up in Zurich.

�Vodafone�s Italian business has been struggling, so shedding this weight should help the group refocus,� said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. �Attention will now turn to how effectively Vodafone uses its resources to fix wider challenges, including high debts, costs and some increasing competition. �

Its refreshed strategy also has seen it seek to merge its U.K. business with Three U.K. to create Britain�s biggest mobile phone network worth around 15 billion pounds ($19 billion). The proposed tie-up will face regulatory scrutiny over competition concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

March 15 (Reuters) - European shares dipped on Friday as risk sentiment remained subdued due to mounting concerns the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate cuts, though strength in telecommunications stocks helped stem losses.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended 0.2% lower after touching record highs in three of the past five sessions.

The STOXX 600 clocked its eighth consecutive week of gains, supported by an array of upbeat corporate updates and expectations of interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.

Market participants are drawing relief from the recent slowdown in inflation in the euro zone, with some European Central Bank policymakers backing a June rate cut.

""With inflation on track to reach its target in the second half of the year, the ECB will cut its deposit rate from 4% to 3% by year-end and to around 2.25% by the middle of 2025,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics in a note.

Meanwhile, hotter-than-expected inflation data from the United States earlier this week has muddied the Fed's monetary policy path.

""Investors are now thinking that rate relief may arrive in July rather than June, with expectations nearing coin-flip odds for the earlier month,"" Jose Torres, Senior Economist at Interactive Brokers said.

The rate-sensitive real estate index led losses with a 2.0% decline on Friday and was also the worst sectoral performer for the week.

The index was also weighed down by a 10.6% drop in Vonovia shares after Germany's largest landlord reported its biggest loss ever in 2023 following further writedowns on the values of its properties.

Among others, Swisscom shares gained 4.9% after the telecom company said it will buy Vodafone Italia for 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) and merge the business with its Italian subsidiary Fastweb.

Vodafone shares jumped 5.7%, pushing the broader telecommunications up 1.5%.

Vodafone exits Italy in final step in CEO's growth plan,"LONDON (Reuters) -Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle said on Friday she was ""changing the face"" of the British mobile operator by selling its Italian unit to Swisscom, the final step in her plan to retrench to markets where the company can profitably grow.

Vodafone's long-suffering shareholders will receive 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) via share buybacks from the Italian sale and a deal agreed last year to exit Spain.

But they will see their dividend payout halve from the financial year starting next month to 4.5 euro cents a share, reflecting the lower cash flow from the smaller footprint.

Vodafone's shares, down 46% in the last two years, rose 6% to 69 pence, giving the company a market value of 18.9 billion pounds ($23.8 billion).

""Going forward, our businesses will be operating in growing telco markets - where we hold strong positions - enabling us to deliver predictable, stronger growth in Europe,"" Della Valle said.

Investors in Vodafone, the mobile group that expanded across Europe and Africa in the first decade of the century, have been promised better growth for years.

But it has struggled against new entrants in Spain and Italy who have slashed tariffs, and strategic mistakes in its largest market, Germany.

The company said on Friday it would replace the boss of Germany, Philippe Rogge, with Vodafone UK's Ahmed Essam in a new role of Executive Chairman Germany and Chief Executive European Markets.

Della Valle, an Italian who joined Vodafone in the country in 1994 and became the group's chief financial officer in 2018, has not delayed taking action to address underperformance since moving to the top job in April last year, unlike her predecessor who faced criticism for not biting the bullet.

Analysts said the deals in Italy and Spain, plus the cut to the dividend, would improve Vodafone's financial profile, including payout coverage, but they increased the pressure for the German business to improve.

One top 20 shareholder, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Vodafone had not secured knock out prices for its two assets, and the dividend cut was at the higher end of expectations.

But the investor said the company needed to strip the business back to its core, and start growing again.

By moving at pace, the company and its boss has earned the right to be given more time to show they could now improve operational performance, the investor added.

Vodafone will receive 8 billion euros in cash from the Vodafone Italy deal, the last of three markets Della Valle vowed to tackle less than a year ago.

It agreed last year to sell its Spanish operation to Zegona Communications and merge its British unit with Hutchison's Three UK, leaving it focused on Germany, smaller European countries, Africa and business.

""Our reshaped footprint will give us the opportunity to generate good returns, with an immediate return on capital step up of over one percentage point when the Italian and Spanish transactions complete,"" Della Valle told reporters.

The company will return 4 billion euros of the proceeds from both deals to investors via share buybacks, and will target a new net debt ratio of 2.25�2.75 times adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation, after leases, against the current objective of 2.5 times.

Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said he would target the lower half of the range.

Vodafone offloads Italian business to Swiss rival for �8bn,"Vodafone will offload its Italian business to a Swiss rival for �8bn (�6.8bn) as the struggling telecoms giant forges ahead with plans to slim down operations.

Confirmation of an agreement with Swisscom was announced by Vodafone on Friday morning, as the company said it would return proceeds from the sale to investors through a share buyback.

As part of the deal, Vodafone will continue to provide services to Swisscom for up to five years, with an annual charge of roughly �350m.

The two companies said they were also exploring a closer commercial relationship outside Italy.

Swisscom, which is majority-owned by the Swiss government, is the largest telecoms company in Switzerland.

It also operates in Italy through the mobile and broadband firm Fastweb.

Vodafone said the deal marked the final step in the reshaping of its European operations after the �5bn sale of its Spanish operations to Zegona.

Bosses said the deals would create a combined �12bn in cash proceeds.

This has enabled the launch of a �4bn share buyback, with an option to buy back a further �2bn after the Italy deal is completed.

However, Vodafone will also halve its dividend to 4.5 cents per share from next year.

Under chief executive Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone has looked to trim its sprawling business and return to growth.

The telecoms giant has inked a �15bn deal with Three to create the UK�s largest mobile network, though this faces regulatory scrutiny on both competition and national security grounds.

But it is still struggling to turn around its fortunes in Germany, its largest market.

Vodafone said it will restructure the group into five business divisions. As part of this overhaul, Vodafone Germany boss Philippe Rogge will step down.

Karen Egan at Enders Analysis said: �The company is highlighting how well it is positioned to grow now without Italy and Spain, and with the prospect of a better position in the UK.

�Germany is more important than ever, and the jury is still out on that turnaround.�

Vodafone said the deal with Swisscom is subject to regulatory clearance and approval from its shareholders.

It has agreed that if shareholders do not approve the deal and it enters into an alternative transaction within 12 months, it will pay Swisscom a break fee of �150m.

Ms Della Valle said: �The sale of Vodafone Italy to Swisscom creates significant value for Vodafone and ensures the business maintains its leading position in Italy, which has been built through the dedicated commitment of our colleagues to serving our customers over many years.

�Going forward, our businesses will be operating in growing telco markets - where we hold strong positions - enabling us to deliver predictable, stronger growth in Europe.�

Vodafone also announced that Max Taylor will take up the role of UK chief executive.

Vodafone agrees �6.8bn sale of Italian arm to Swisscom,"Vodafone has agreed an eight billion eight (�6.8 billion) deal to sell its Italian business to Switzerland�s Swisscom.

The mobile phone giant said it plans to hand four billion euros (�3.4 billion) back to shareholders through a buyback following the sale.

It comes two weeks after the telecoms firms first confirmed they were in discussions over a potential deal.

On Friday, London-listed Vodafone said the move represented an �attractive valuation� and marked the final step of its strategy to sell off parts of its European portfolio.

Swisscom will pay 100% cash in a move which will be fully debt-financed.

As part of the transaction, the two firms have agreed that Vodafone will continue to provide �certain services� to Swisscom over the next five years.

Swisscom will pay annual charges of around 350 million euros (�299 million).

Vodafone added that the two companies are also �exploring a closer commercial relationship to enable collaboration across a broad range of areas, beyond Italy�.

Margherita Della Valle, group chief executive of Vodafone, said: �Today, I am announcing the third and final step in the reshaping of our European operations.

�Going forward, our businesses will be operating in growing telco markets � where we hold strong positions � enabling us to deliver predictable, stronger growth in Europe.

�The sale of Vodafone Italy to Swisscom creates significant value for Vodafone and ensures the business maintains its leading position in Italy, which has been built through the dedicated commitment of our colleagues to serving our customers over many years.�

Vodafone has been looking to free up cash and improve its financial performance by selling off parts of the business, including its Spanish arm, having previously struck deals to sell its Hungarian and Ghanaian divisions.

Its refreshed strategy has also seen it seek to merge its UK business with Three UK to create Britain�s biggest mobile phone network worth �15 billion.

The proposed merger of the networks is set to be formally investigated by the UK�s competition regulator over concerns it could substantially reduce options for mobile customers, but Vodafone is hoping to complete the tie-up by the end of the year.

It is also planning to cut about 11,000 jobs over three years as part of efforts to simplify the global business, which could affect markets worldwide.

About a third of the role reductions had already been completed by January this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swisscom buys Vodafone Italia for $8.7 billion as telcos consolidate,"ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) -Swisscom said on Friday it would buy Vodafone Italia for 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) and merge the business with its Italian subsidiary Fastweb in the latest round of consolidation in Europe's most competitive telecoms markets.

The deal follows the merger of French mobile operator Orange's Spanish business with rival MasMovil, that was approved earlier this week, and Vodafone selling its Spanish unit to Zegona Communications last October.

Swiss government-controlled Swisscom said the all-cash deal would be debt financed.

Vodafone said it would return 4 billion euros of capital to shareholders and halve its dividend to 4.5 euro cents a share from its 2025 financial year onwards after the deals in Italy and Spain and the sale of its Spanish operation.

Its shares were 5.7% up in London while Swisscom gained 4.2% on the Zurich exchange at 1250 GMT.

Analysts at Berenberg said Swisscom was increasing its exposure to the highly competitive Italian market and diversifying further away from its safe-haven Swiss core.

But its signal of an 18% rise in its dividend for the 2025 financial year, payable in 2026, and increased growth boosted by cost synergies had ""helped to take the sting out of the announcement"", they added.

The Swisscom deal will create Italy's second-biggest fixed-line broadband operator behind TIM, with a strong presence in the prized business segment, and a leading player in mobile.

It comes as mobile operators have struggled to make returns on capital in Italy after France's Iliad arrived in 2018 with cut-price offers.

Swisscom CEO Christoph Aeschlimann said the deal made strategic sense in view of his company's long involvement in Italy and the ""flattish"" development at home.

""We are in the Italian market in 17 years so this is a next step... reinforcing our position in the market where we are very successful,"" he told reporters. ""I am 100% convinced that this transaction strengthens Swisscom as a whole.""

Swisscom's move was backed by Bern, which holds a 51% stake, Aeschlimann said.

The Swiss government said it would review its Swisscom stake this year, including ""issues of privatization or partial privatization of the company,"" without giving more details.

Swisscom has targeted 600 million euros in annual savings mainly from migrating mobile customers from Fastweb to the Vodafone network.

The deal is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2025, and will not require a shareholder vote.

FINAL STEP

Vodafone's CEO Margherita Della Valle said the deal was the third and final step in reshaping its European portfolio after she agreed to sell its Spanish operation and merge its British unit with Hutchison's Three last year.

In 2022, her predecessor Nick Read rejected an approach worth more than 11 billion euros from Iliad and Apax Partners for the Italian business.

Iliad, whose owner Xavier Niel holds a 2.5% stake in Vodafone, came back with a proposal in December to create a joint venture worth 14.7 billion euros, but was again rebuffed.

Della Valle said she had considered a number of options for Italy, and Swisscom provided the best combination of value creation, up-front cash proceeds and ""deliverability"".

She said the deal would be reviewed in Italy rather than by the European Commission, meaning a faster decision and less risk of remedies.

The Iliad option would have left Vodafone ""exposed to a highly leveraged joint venture in Italy"", she added.

"There Is Smoke From the M&A Rumor Mill, but Is There Fire?","Where there is smoke, there might be fire. As such, it behooves this analyst to investigate to see if there is some money to be made. The rumor mill has been quite active this past couple of weeks on mergers and acquisitions with the following three I find interesting and plausible. They appear to be good value, too.First, there have been whispers about a potential takeover of Vodafone Group PLC (NASDAQ:VOD). According to a Betaville alert, there is speculation that American telecom companies are eyeing the European telecom as a potential takeover target. Additionally, rumors suggest one of Vodafone's existing shareholders might be increasing their stake.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with VOD.

Furthermore, there are indications that Vodafone has received a new offer for its Italian unit. Although details remain undisclosed, sources following the matter have reported this development. In the past month, Iliad SA (XPAR:ILD) revealed that Vodafone rejected a revised proposal to merge their Italian businesses. Notably, Vodafone had previously turned down an offer exceeding 11 billion euros ($11.94 billion) for its Italian unit from an Iliad-backed consortium in 2022.Second, recent market murmurs suggest packaging company Sealed Air Corp. (NYSE:SEE) could be a potential takeover target. Berry Global (NYSE:BERY) is said to be interested. The stock has experienced a 28% decline over the past year, and the absence of a permanent CEO adds to the intrigue. As of now, Chief Operating Officer Emile Chammas and Chief Financial Officer Dustin Semach are stepping in as interim co-presidents and co-CEOs, continuing their existing responsibilities. The situation remains fluid, and market watchers are closely monitoring developments in this dynamic landscape.Finally, shares of Altice USA Inc. (NYSE:ATUS), a broadband provider, surged after rumors circulated that Charter Communications (CHTR) may be sniffing around. Altice has high short interest, so it is possible the rumors may have been circulated to flush the shorts out, but maybe not. This seems to happen quite frequently.Let us take a look at these stocks from a fundamental point of view, regardless of whether or not the rumors are true, to see if they are worth buying.

Vodafone
Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) has been a melting icecube for a long time, but lately it has been turning in good numbers, so the takeover rumors may have some legs. Further, Ebit per share has been on a positive trajectory over the last five years.

Vodafone's stock is dirt cheap with a price-earnings ratio of 2.08 (forward price-earnings ratio is 13.04). Morningstar also rates the stock as five-star, though it does not give it an economic moat.Based on the simple value and growth factors methodology I detailed in ""The Zen of Price,"" Vodafone shows up very well on both value and growth factors. In short, the factors are derived as follows:

Value factor = Operating profits/ (enterprise value 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate)Growth factor = Five-year Ebitda growth rate per share divided by 5.

Sealed Air
Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) looks significantly undervalued on the GF Value chart. Also Morningstar gives it a five-star rating on value, while also conferring on it a narrow economic moat due to high switching costs its customers will incur if they were to go to a competitor. The company makes packaging and packaging equipment, especially for food manufacturers.

Sealed Air does face some short-term challenges with both operating income and revenue tracking below the five-year trendline. However, the trendline is sloping upward, which is a good sign. The company experienced a boom in business in 2021-22 when customers stocked up on packaging material, pulling forward sales. As a result, the company has been experiencing an inventory whiplash effect. However, I think this is temporary and should abate over the next year or so.

Altice USA
Altice (NYSE:ATUS) stock has been a disaster, to put it mildly. In 2015, Altice Europe acquired the privately held U.S. cable company Suddenlink, followed by the acquisition of Cablevision in 2016. Suddenlink serves approximately 3.50 million U.S. homes and businesses, primarily in smaller markets, with significant clusters in Texas, West Virginia, Idaho, Arizona and Louisiana. Meanwhile, Cablevision provides similar services to around 5.50 million homes and businesses in the New York City metro area. Both regions operate under the Optimum brand name. Subsequently, Altice Europe spun off Altice USA, which encompasses both Suddenlink and Cablevision, to shareholders in 2018.

Altice is controlled by the French-Israeli businessman Patrick Drahi. Drahi controls Altice through Class B shares, which are not publicly traded (unlike publicly traded Class A shares, which have one vote per share). Class B shares of Altice USA are entitled to 25 votes per share. The much higher voting power of Class B shares allows insiders to maintain control over corporate decisions without dilution from public shareholders. Thus, public shareholders are at the mercy of Drahi & Co., which is both good and bad.

While Drahi will most likely make decisions on a long-term basis, which should in theory benefit common class A shareholders, there is potential for conflict of interest. There is a possibility of a ""take under,"" whereas Drahi could engineer a privatization of the company while the stock is deeply undervalued and short-change the common shareholders. There is also a possibility of a bankruptcy because of the high debt which Altice USA carries. The short interest is quite high with about 15% of the shares sold short.In terms of simple value and growth factors, Altice shows up decently with a combined score of 3.52 as of December. Thus, Altice is another dirt cheap stock, as long as punters like us are mindful of the high debt load and low financial strength score of only 3. The stock could well go to zero. The Altman Z-score is a cringe-worthy 0.41.

Conclusion
While the financier and investor Bernard Baruch once wryly observed that the main purpose of the stock market is to make fools of as many men as possible, the Roman stoic philosopher Seneca reminded the world long ago that luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. The above listed opportunities may well be only smoke and mirrors based on rumors, but fundamentally do look like decent bets. I would be surprised if no one is sniffing around. As I have often observed, good things do happen to cheap stocks if they can avoid going bust. One way of avoiding going bust is to sell out at the right time.

Bitcoin soars close to record high,"Bitcoin has topped $60,000 for the first time in more than two years amid a flurry of excitement after the approval of wider trading methods in the US.

The world�s largest cryptocurrency has surged by more than 42pc in February in what is the largest monthly gain since December 2020 during the pandemic-era boom.

Bitcoin was last up about 6pc today to $60,376 -  its highest since November 2021, when it hit a record just below $70,000.

It comes as traders have poured money into the digital token following the approval of so-called spot exchange traded funds, known as ETFs.

The financial instruments allow investors to speculate on movements in the price of crypto without the risk of owning the asset.

Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, said: �Essentially, we�re seeing the ETF effect ahead of schedule.

�Inflows into them stepped up quickly last week and have been sustained, and we think it�s reflective of advisors getting out there very quickly to start selling the ETFs to clients.�

Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of Nexo crypto exchange, added: �If $60,000 doesn�t whet the appetite, consider that 70pc of bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for a year, and the little that�s left is being hoovered up by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, just as rewards for miners are about to be slashed in half.

Swisscom Nears �8 Billion Deal for Vodafone�s Italian Unit,"Swisscom AG is in advanced talks to buy Vodafone Group Plc�s Italian business for �8 billion ($8.7 billion) on a cash and debt-free basis after fending off competition from rivals including French billionaire Xavier Niel. The exclusive discussions to merge Vodafone Italia and Swisscom�s Fastweb SpA business would create a more efficient company, Swisscom said in a statement on Wednesday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. The agreement isn�t final and there�s no certainty a deal will go through, the company said.

Vodafone prefers Swisscom�s bid over a previous proposal from Niel�s Iliad because it has a larger cash component, a person familiar with the matter said. The British phone company last month rejected Iliad�s final offer, which proposed forming a joint venture with the Vodafone business in Italy in a bid that included �6.6 billion in cash proceeds for an enterprise value of �10.45 billion.

Read More: Iliad Says Vodafone Rejected New Offer for Italian Unit

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:

Vodafone�s advanced talks to sell its Italian unit for �8 billion to Swisscom makes its rejection of Iliad�s �10.5 billion JV bid questionable given the latter would result in �6.6 billion in cash and a 50% stake in the combined entity � a riskier but likely more value-accretive option. Swisscom�s offer implies a 7.6x forward EV/Ebitdaal multiple, in line with the 5x-11x comparable M&A range, while reducing leverage 0.4x.

� Erhan Gurses, BI telecoms analyst

Fastweb�s Chief Executive Officer Walter Renna, a company veteran who took the top job in October, is working to maintain the growth his predecessor, Alberto Calcagno, oversaw for 40 consecutive quarters. Revenue rose 6% last year and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and leases gained 3%, according to a statement earlier this month.

Vodafone Italia and Fastweb are the country�s second- and fourth-biggest operators, respectively, with combined sales of about �7 billion annually. Italy accounts about 11% of Vodafone�s revenue and is its largest market after Germany and the UK.

The Swisscom offer is expected to face scrutiny of local authorities as well as European ones. Regulators may be less inclined to intervene because Italy would still have four mobile carriers if the deal goes through. Reducing the number to three in a market is seen as a red line for many potential tie-ups.

However, there are signs that the executive branch of the 27-member European Union is easing its position on competition. In Spain, Orange SA�s local unit and Masmovil Ibercom SA won conditional approval from the European Commission last week for a tie-up to create the country�s largest operator after agreeing to certain remedies.

The Vodafone deal is poised to kick off talk of more merger and acquisitions in Italy, one of Europe�s most competitive markets. Iliad�s 2018 entry into the country offering cheaper, no-frills mobile plans helped spark a price war.

Monthly subscriptions for full-fiber landline services, which usually include unlimited Internet, can cost as little as �20 to �25, about a quarter of what most US consumers pay.

Even after its failed attempts to buy Vodafone�s Italian business, Iliad could still pursue deals. Last year Iliad�s country head Benedetto Levi said the phone company would play an active role if M&A opportunities in Italy emerge.

Telecom Italia SpA, the former phone monopoly, is also on the lookout as it awaits the closing of a �22 billion deal to sell its landline grid to KKR & Co, expected this summer.

�We are ready to do our part on M&A activity in the country when we will finalize the KKR deal,� Telecom Italia Chief Executive Officer Pietro Labriola said this month in a conference call with analysts.

CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. has considered a number of deals for its Wind Tre SpA unit. In February, it halted a deal to sell a controlling stake in Wind Tre SpA network to buyout firm EQT AB.

Vodafone in talks to sell Italian arm to rival for �6.8bn,"Vodafone has entered exclusive talks to sell its Italian business to Swisscom, weeks after rejecting an approach by French billionaire Xavier Niel.

Any deal to offload the business could raise �8bn (�6.8bn) in funds for the UK telecoms giant, as it battles to slim down its global operations.

In a statement on Tuesday, the company said: �Vodafone has engaged extensively with several parties to explore market consolidation in Italy and believes this potential transaction delivers the best combination of value creation, upfront cash proceeds and transaction certainty for Vodafone shareholders.�

It cautioned that the deal was subject to binding documents and there was no certainty it would ultimately be agreed.

Shares rose almost 4pc in early trading.

It comes after Vodafone last month rebuffed a bid from Iliad Group, the empire controlled by telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel.

That offer would have valued the Italian business at �10.5bn but it consisted of only �6.6bn of cash upfront. Vodafone would have retained half the share capital of the combined entity.

The proposed deal with Swisscom is less likely to attract scrutiny from competition regulators than a tie-up with Iliad, which operates in France and Poland.

Swisscom, which is majority-owned by the Swiss government, is the largest telecoms company in Switzerland.

It already operates in Italy through the mobile and broadband firm Fastweb.

Karen Egan at Enders Analysis described the sale as a �bold move� that would leave Vodafone�s European operations dominated by the UK and Germany.

She added: �I�m somewhat surprised that they�re leaving Italy altogether given their history there but it�s the right move.�

It marks the latest deal pursued by Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle as she looks to trim the sprawling telecoms giant and return it to growth.

The company has recently agreed a �15bn deal to merge with Three in the UK, creating the country�s largest mobile network.

However, that deal is under review by the Competition and Markets Authority over concerns it could push up prices for consumers.

It is also being examined on national security grounds amid fears that Three�s Chinese owner CK Hutchison could gain access to sensitive national infrastructure.

Vodafone has also agreed to sell its Spanish operations to Zegona, an investment vehicle led by former Virgin Media executives, for �5bn.

Ms Della Valle this week called for regulators to loosen rules around telecoms mergers in Europe, insisting it was �not economical� to run multiple 5G networks in the same country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swisscom confirms talks to buy Vodafone's Italian unit for 8B euros,"GENEVA (AP) � Telecoms operator Swisscom confirmed Wednesday it's in talks with Vodafone Group toward a possible purchase of its Italian subsidiary for 8 billion euros ($8.65 billion).

The Swiss company, which is majority owned by the Swiss government, said in a statement it's in �advanced exclusive negotiations� to buy all of Vodafone Italia and merge it with Swisscom's Italian subsidiary, Fastweb.

Swisscom says it expects the purchase, if concluded, would add value and cash flow to the Swiss company and help improve its dividend policy.

The Swiss telecoms operator says the deal would bring lower costs and pave the way for synergies, and comply with aims of the Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swisscom closes in on $8.7 billion deal to buy Vodafone Italia,"LONDON (Reuters) -Swisscom said on Wednesday it was in exclusive talks to buy all of Vodafone Italia for 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) to merge the business with its Italian subsidiary Fastweb.

The proposed purchase would be in cash and on a debt-free basis, the two companies said in separate statements.

Shares in Vodafone, which last month rejected a rival proposal from Iliad, rose 1%, with Swisscom 0.5% lower.

A deal would create Italy's second-largest fixed-line broadband operator behind TIM, with a strong presence in the prized business segment, and a leading player in mobile.

It would also cap a busy first year for Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle, who had vowed to tackle three problematic markets in which it makes no return on its capital.

If a deal is struck, Della Valle will have reshaped all three markets, after she agreed to sell its Spanish operation and merge its British unit with Hutchison's Three last year.

Vodafone last month rejected an offer to create a joint venture with Iliad in Italy, under which it would have received 6.6 billion euros in cash in a deal valuing Vodafone Italia at 10.45 billion euros.

It said it was considering other options and Reuters reported this month that Swisscom was the only remaining party in talks with the British company over its Italian business.

CERTAINTY

Vodafone said on Wednesday it believed the proposed Swisscom deal delivered the ""best combination of value creation, upfront cash proceeds and transaction certainty"".

Swisscom said it would boost its cash flow and would have ""a positive impact on its dividend policy"".

Swiss investment company Vontobel said the deal would create a strong contender in Europe's most challenging telco market but given the debt burden and integration efforts, a near-term positive impact on Swisscom's dividend policy was unlikely.

Swisscom's Fastweb currently provides mobile services on Hutchison's Wind Tre's network, and the two companies have an agreement to roll out 5G networks.

Della Valle, who started her Vodafone career in Italy, is seeking to improve Vodafone's profitability by striking major deals, something which eluded her predecessor.

The major advantage of a Fastweb deal was a much lower regulatory bar than combining with Iliad, albeit at the cost of lower potential synergies, analysts have said.

Investors have been lukewarm about Della Valle's changes and Vodafone's shares trade at around half the level they did two years ago, with some fretting about a possible dividend cut.

Vodafone has said it will update the market on shareholder returns policy by its full-year results in May.

Vodafone completes 3G network switch off,"Vodafone has completed the switch off of its legacy 3G network, the mobile operator has said, as it repurposes 3G radio frequencies to be used by newer 4G and 5G networks.

The 3G switch off is being carried out by all major mobile operators to free up network space for 4G and 5G, which allow for faster data services and better voice calls.

Confirmation of the completion of Vodafone�s switch off follows a similar announcement from EE, while Three has previously said it will turn off its 3G network by the end of 2024.

Comparison site Uswitch said that while the 3G switch off would not impact the majority of users, older device users may have to take some action.

�The 3G switch off is essential for freeing-up the �network spectrum� for 4G and 5G, which will ultimately be used to cope with the increasing demand our digital lives place on the network,� a Uswitch spokesperson said.

�The vast majority of phone users won�t need to do anything, but it is important to be aware this change is taking place, particularly for those with older relatives, who may rely on older handsets.

�Our recent research revealed that 2.7 million mobile users were still unsure if their device was ready for the switch off � with those age +75 more likely to be in this boat.

�While Vodafone and EE are both reporting their 3G switch-off now, other mobile phone providers will also soon be following suit, switching off 3G over the next couple of years.

�Mobile phone users should check device settings and make sure their phone is 4G or 5G ready, as well as ensuring they have the latest software and security updates.

�It�s important that no one is left behind so it�s worth checking in with friends and relatives too in case they have older devices.�

Vodafone said it had been notifying customers since January 2022 of the upcoming national switch off to ensure a smooth transition for the public.

The firm�s UK network director, Andrea Dona, said: �The 3G legacy switch off has been a massive programme and I�d like to thank my team for their hard work to make this a success.

�With switch off complete, we can start to redeploy the remaining spectrum which will ultimately lead to stronger and faster 4G and 5G across the UK.

�All on top of our existing 4G and 5G network improvement programmes.

�Good news for our customers, businesses and the wider UK economy.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vodafone to be minor partner in any Italian tie-up with Swisscom, sources say","MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone will likely hold a minority stake in a combined entity with Swisscom's Italian unit Fastweb if a deal is reached on a potential tie-up of their Italian operations, three people familiar with the matter said.

Vodafone's Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said earlier this month the British group was in ""active discussions"" in Italy, days after rebuffing a proposal by rival Iliad to create a 50:50 joint venture in the country.

Multiple sources have identified Swisscom's Fastweb as the other party in the talks.

The potential deal being discussed would see Vodafone take a minority stake in the combined entity, which would take its debt off Vodafone's balance sheet, said the people, who declined to be named because talks are not public and are ongoing.

Spokespeople for Vodafone and Swisscom declined to comment.

Operators in Italy are studying ways to consolidate a market grappling with shrinking revenue and margins, which is depriving investors of returns on their capital.

A deal with Fastweb would create Italy's second-largest fixed-line broadband operator with a strong presence in the prized business segment.

It would also face lower regulatory hurdles than a combination with Iliad but offers lower potential synergies, according to analysts.

Iliad, majority owned by French billionaire Xavier Niel, is continuing to push consolidation in Europe, and on Monday it unveiled an agreement to buy a 19.8% stake in Swedish telecoms operator Tele2 from investment company Kinnevik.

Italy is the final major market Vodafone wants to fix after it agreed last year to merge with Hutchison's Three in Britain and sell its struggling Spanish operation.

Della Valle, however, has said Italy is a very different market from Spain for Vodafone.

She said in November that Vodafone was outperforming its major competitors in Italy with its strong brand and network, but it was a very challenging market in which no player was delivering returns in excess of cost of capital.

Vodafone would probably not include in its accounts any entity in which it holds a stake of 50% or lower, which would take the new company's debt off its books but limit any control over its cash flows, meaning it could not rely on the income to fund its own shareholder returns.

Vodafone has already said it will review its capital allocation, including its dividend and any buyback, after the Spanish deal completes, expected in the first half of this year.

Della Valle told analysts this month that she still intended to update shareholders on its new capital allocation policy in May, regardless of the outcome of the Italian talks.

"Bid to build �15bn mobile titan would damage coverage upgrades, warns rival","A �15bn merger between Vodafone and Three risks leaving rivals with patchier connections unless their market power is curbed, the boss of Virgin Media O2 has suggested.

Lutz Sch�ler warned the tie-up would hand the combined company too much control of valuable radio spectrum used to operate mobile networks.

He said: �We understand the industry logic [for the merger] and need to support economies of scale.

�But we could not support our customers if the deal goes ahead without an agreement on spectrum and network sharing.�

VMO2 warned that the merged companies� stranglehold over spectrum would lead to worse connections on rival networks and ultimately harm consumers.

Mobile spectrum relates to the various radio frequencies allocated to mobile operators and other communications businesses. Usage is regulated by Ofcom.

Spectrum is expected to be a key bone of contention among rival operators ahead of the planned Vodafone-Three merger, which would create the UK�s largest mobile network with 27 million customers.

The combined company would hold almost 50pc of all mobile spectrum and just under 60pc of C-band frequencies, a valuable portion of spectrum considered ideal for 5G.

VMO2 has already raised concerns with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has opened an investigation into the transaction.

However, VMO2 is also in direct negotiations with Vodafone and Three over a potential deal, and Mr Sch�ler said regulatory intervention may not be necessary.

BT-owned EE is also expected to call for spectrum concessions as part of the competition review.

Aside from spectrum, Mr Sch�ler also called for long-term assurances about VMO2�s current network sharing agreement with Vodafone.

The two companies jointly own mobile masts through their Cornerstone towers business. VMO2 sold part of its stake in a �360m deal last year, but retains a 33pc holding.

The warning from a major rival will add to concerns about the impact of the merger between Vodafone and Three.

MPs have called on the CMA to launch an in-depth investigation into the deal amid concerns that reducing the number of UK mobile operators from four to three could push up prices for consumers.

In 2016, regulators blocked a proposed tie-up between O2 and Three on competition grounds.

However, Vodafone and Three have argued that the market has changed considerably since then and say they require scale to keep investing in their networks.

Speaking at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Vodafone chief executive Margherita Della Valle said: �In-market consolidation needs to become possible in Europe. In a 5G world, it�s just not economical. It makes no sense to have four parallel 5G networks.�

The companies have pledged to invest �11bn in their combined UK 5G network over the next decade and create up to 12,000 new jobs. They have also insisted that the deal will not push up prices for consumers.

Separately, the deal is being reviewed on national security grounds amid concerns that Three�s Hong Kong-based parent company CK Hutchison could gain access to sensitive national infrastructure.

Vodafone boss says European regulators need to �reboot� and be more supportive of growth in the sector,"The chief executive of Vodafone Group has stated that European regulators need a �reboot� as she advances with her UK merger deal.

�We are at a new junction,� Margherita Della Valle said, �and to be on the right road, European policymakers need to change direction now.�

�They need to reboot our legacy telecoms regulation and create a real single market supporting 5G standalone rollout at pace,� added Della Valle, who has led Vodafone since April last year.

She made these remarks to an audience consisting of global telecoms industry players gathered at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona on Monday.

Della Valle is currently pushing ahead with a proposed tie-up between Vodafone�s UK business and Three UK, announced last summer.

In January, the UK�s competition watchdog launched a formal Phase 1 investigation into the merger of Vodafone and Three, which is owned by the Chinese firm CK Hutchinson.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has urged third parties, including other network operators, to provide their perspectives on how the proposed merger might impact competition.

It is due to publish the findings of the initial probe by 22 March 2024, which could trigger another investigation.

The CMA has the power to block mergers or demand concessions from companies to address competition or national security concerns.

Vodafone and Three UK argue that their merger is necessary to successfully roll out 5G, which Della Valle said is a �multi-trillion opportunity� for Europe to increase industrial efficiency, boost innovation, and improve public services.

�Europe needs investment, and investors need to see changes such as a competition policy that allows each market to reach the economies of scale 5G requires and a real single market, with one set of European rules instead of 27 sets of national rules,� she explained.

However, some have argued that the merger deal, which would reduce the UK telecoms market from four players to three, could harm competition, raise prices for consumers, and raise national security concerns.

There may already be a shift underway. Last week, the European Commission approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the proposed creation of a joint venture by Orange and the Spanish telco M�sM�vil.

Kester Mann, a telecoms analyst at CCS Insight, said both parties will hope that this news represents a shift in position from the region�s regulators.

�But they should be cautious,� he warned, �this deal will be reviewed by the UK�s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), whose stubbornness last year in initially blocking the tie-up between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard shows it won�t be won over easily.�

Orange and M�sM�vil also had to offer a package of remedies to get their deal over the line, which included offering spectrum and national roaming access to a rival provider, Digi.

�If Vodafone and Three are required to do similar, they would be reliant on finding a willing third party to complete the deal. That may not be easy,� Mann explained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Investigation into Vodafone-Three merger must be scaled up, say MPs","A competition investigation into Vodafone�s �15bn merger with Three must be scaled up, MPs have said.

In a letter to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the Business and Trade Committee warned that �significant doubts� had been raised about the benefits of combining the two mobile networks.

They added: �As such, the committee believes that the CMA has a duty to launch an in-depth [phase 2] assessment.�

The CMA last month opened an initial phase one investigation into the tie-up between Vodafone and Three, which will create the UK�s largest mobile network with around 27 million customers.

The regulator has been gathering evidence since October and has up to 40 days to examine the deal in its initial review.

It will then decide whether to refer the transaction to a more detailed phase two investigation, which would last until autumn.

Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle
Vodafone boss, Margherita Della Valle, says the national security review was progressing �as planned� - Vodafone
Vodafone and Three have vowed to invest �11bn in their combined UK 5G network over the next decade and create up to 12,000 new jobs.

They have also insisted that the merger will not push up the price of mobile bills for consumers.

In the letter, committee chair Liam Byrne MP pointed to evidence from economists and mobile experts that he said cast doubts over these claims.

Tommaso Valletti, professor of economics at Imperial College London, told MPs in October he had found no evidence that combining mobile networks increases investment.

He also said consumer prices decline more slowly in markets with three mobile networks than in those with four.

Unite, the union, has also raised concerns about job cuts and price hikes, saying the CMA has a �clear responsibility to block this deal�.

Mr Byrne added: �I trust that you will take this evidence into account when making your decision.�

Other witnesses in the committee�s evidence session, including Enders Analysis, have played down concerns about price rises, saying research had not found a correlation between pricing levels and the number of network operators.

Separately, Vodafone and Three are facing a national security investigation into the deal, due to concerns that Three�s Hong Kong-based parent company CK Hutchison could be granted access to sensitive national infrastructure.

Both Vodafone and Three have rejected the concerns, arguing that CK Hutchison has been in the UK market for two decades.

Earlier this month, Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle said the national security review was progressing �as planned�.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Swisscom sole remaining party in talks for Vodafone Italy, sources say","LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Swisscom is the only party in discussions over a potential Vodafone tie-up in Italy, sources close to the matter told Reuters.

A combination with Swisscom's Fastweb Italian business is the sole option Vodafone has been working on after its January rejection of a bid to merge its Italian operations with those of Iliad, the three sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

Iliad had proposed a 50-50 joint venture with Vodafone in Italy to create an operator with a combined enterprise value of 14.7 billion euros ($15.8 billion).

Spokespeople for Vodafone and Swisscom declined to comment.

Vodafone said on Jan. 31 that it was no longer in talks with Iliad but discussions ""with others"" continued.

In a trading update five days later, however, Vodafone Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle dropped the reference to others and merely said the company was in ""active discussions"".

Like other telecoms operators in the Italian mobile market, Vodafone is grappling with shrinking revenue and increasing pressure on margins.

Rising competition has sent total revenue in the Italian market down 21% in the past decade to 27.1 billion euros, according to trade association Asstel.

A deal with Swisscom's Fastweb would create Italy's second-largest fixed-line broadband operator, with a strong presence in the prized business segment.

It would be likely to face lower regulatory hurdles than a combination with Iliad but offers lower potential cost benefits, according to analysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
European telecom stocks rally on merger optimism,"(Reuters) - Shares in Vodafone led a sudden spike across European telecom stocks on Wednesday.

Vodafone rose as much as 7% in London, and other telecom stocks in Europe also saw a burst higher, with BT last up 2.8%, while M Telecom Italia rose 1.1%, Swisscom added 1.1%, and Orange and Telefonica rose less than 1%.

Two London-based traders attributed the rally to a report that raised the prospect of pickup in M&A activity in the sector.

Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the EU could relax merger rules in the sector and get large tech companies help fund costly network upgrades.

The European Commission document seen by Reuters, said EU regulators may ease their rules against mobile telecoms mergers and also broaden telecoms rules to get Big Tech and others to help fund the rollout of 5G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E&'s CEO Hatem Dowidar joins Vodafone's board,"(Reuters) - The chief executive of Abu Dhabi telecoms group E&, Hatem Dowidar, will join Vodafone's board later this month as a non-executive director after the British company said it had received the necessary regulatory approvals.

E& is Vodafone's biggest shareholder, with a 14.6% stake, and the two companies formed a strategic agreement in May, which included a board seat for Dowidar.

Britain said last month that E&'s stake in Vodafone posed national security risks in terms of government contracts and cyber security, but it was satisfied with the steps taken to alleviate its concerns.

Dowidar said on Wednesday he looked forward to joining Vodafone's board to ""support the rapid transformation being undertaken by (chief executive) Margherita Della Valle and the management team"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ericsson (ERIC), Vodafone Team Up for 5G Deployment in Romania","Ericsson ERIC announced that it has entered into a six-year agreement with Vodafone Romania. Per the deal, Ericsson will facilitate the upgradation of Vodafone�s existing infrastructure and accelerate the deployment of high-performing 5G networks in the country.

By leveraging Ericsson 5G RAN (Radio Access Network) technology, Vodafone is aiming to offer faster connectivity, low latency and secure network performance to its customers. Ericsson Radio System Portfolio boasts a comprehensive suite of 5G RAN products, including the Ericsson Antenna System, which is an integral component of the RAN infrastructure. This system ensures greater throughput with significantly lower power consumption and reduces operational expenses with enhanced wind load and lower weight.

The solution�s offerings also include Massive MIMO (multiple input multiple output) technology that allows communication service providers to seamlessly utilize the mid-band 5G spectrum. The incorporation of these cutting-edge technologies will ensure a fast and smooth transition to 5G, expediting digital transformation across Romania.

The collaboration with Ericsson is a vital part of Vodafone�s multi-year investment plans that aim to develop strong technological fundamentals to build a future-ready, reliable and energy-efficient network infrastructure. Beyond robust connectivity, this initiative provides an innovative platform for residential users and enterprises to explore advanced use cases, drive industry transformation and foster a more interconnected digital society.

With the emergence of the smartphone market and the subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased exponentially. Further, to maintain performance with increased traffic, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. The company is reportedly the world�s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide.

The company focuses on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors to position itself as a market leader. It believes that the standardization of 5G is the cornerstone for digitizing industries and broadband. Ericsson expects mainstream 4G offerings to give way to 5G technology in the future. It currently has 158 live 5G networks across the globe, spanning 67 countries.

The stock has lost 5.7% over the past year against the industry�s growth of 4.6%.

"Three apologises after network outages affect 10,000 customers across UK","Mobile operator Three has apologised as more than 10,000 customers experienced outages after problems with its service over the last few days.

The company, which has more than 10 million UK customers, issued apologies in posts on X on Saturday, Sunday and Monday regarding a string of problems affecting voice calls and the ability to use mobile data.

�We are very sorry for the issues with service over the past few days and sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused,� Three said in a post on Monday. �We know a number of our customers are still waiting on their service to be restored, and our engineers are working to fully fix it.�

Downdetector, which tracks outages, shows that more than 12,000 people have reported that their phone services have suffered some form of fault.

A spokesperson for Three UK said the issue that affected customers over the weekend is separate to the problems that emerged on Monday, but the end result is the same type of disruption to the network for mobile phone users.

�Following an issue with our network that started earlier, services are now recovering,� it said in an update on X.


Last month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the UK regulator, launched an investigation into the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three, which would create the UK�s largest mobile phone operator.

The firms said the deal would result in an additional investment of �11bn in the UK.

In 2016, the CMA and the European Commission blocked Three�s attempted takeover of O2, arguing that it would have risked higher prices.

However, in 2022 Ofcom, the UK telecoms regulator, changed its long-held stance, saying it was now more open to consolidation in the sector. Ofcom had previously argued that a reduction to only three networks could harm UK consumers.

In a separate move the government is also investigating the stake in Vodafone held by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group.

The Cabinet Office warned that the 14.6% stake held by Emirates Telecommunications Group, which is also known as e&, amounted to a security concern given Vodafone�s strategic role in UK telecoms services.

The government has now ordered a �national security committee� to be set up at Vodafone that will oversee and monitor any sensitive work the telecoms firm carries out that could have an impact on national security.

Vodafone UK has a number of government contracts, and Three UK is owned by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, which may raise concerns about foreign joint-ownership of a key national asset, particularly given the city�s status as part of China.

Vodafone UK has public sector contracts with the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, NHS 111 and local police forces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Down -6.93% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why You Should You Buy the Dip in Vodafone Group PLC (VOD)","Vodafone Group PLC (VOD) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 6.9% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.

Guide to Identifying Oversold Stocks

We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.

Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.

So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.

However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.

Why VOD Could Bounce Back Before Long

The heavy selling of VOD shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.51. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.

The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for VOD has increased 20.1%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.

Moreover, VOD currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone pays out more than $1bn in advisory fees since 2000,"Vodafone has paid out more than $1bn in fees to advisers over the last two decades amid ambitious empire-building followed by a costly retreat.

The British telecoms giant has spent huge sums on bankers and lawyers as part of long-running turnaround efforts, with data from Dealogic revealing that �in excess� of a billion dollars has been spent on advisors since 2000.

The figures show the scale of dealmaking at Vodafone, which has failed to boost the company�s share price beyond what it was around 30 years ago.

Vodafone�s heyday came in the wake of its mammoth $190bn takeover of German rival Mannesmann in 2000, which remains the largest corporate takeover in history.

The deal formed part of Vodafone�s expensive flag-planting campaign during the 1990s and early 2000s as it sought to build a global mobile empire.

But the spate of acquisitions has failed to pay off for Vodafone, as bosses now attempt to slim down operations.

Last year, Vodafone sold its Spanish business for �5bn after struggling with tough competition and low returns.

The FTSE 100 firm also remains in talks about a potential deal in Italy, after last month rejecting a revised offer from French telecoms company Iliad to merge their businesses in the country.

Vodafone�s Indian venture has also been fraught with problems after paying $11bn for mobile network Hutchison Essar in 2007.

In 2020, the London-listed group was forced to provide a $200m cash injection to its loss-making Indian telecom operator, Vodafone Idea, after fierce competition left the business on the brink of collapse.

This came six years after it completed the $130bn sale of its 45pc stake in US mobile operator Verizon Wireless.

Meanwhile, Vodafone is still reeling from its �18.4bn takeover of Liberty Global�s cable network in Germany in 2019, which has weighed heavily on the company�s balance sheet.

Shares have slumped by 55pc over the last five years and are trading at levels last seen in 1996 � well below their peak at the turn of the millennium.

The company has now inked a �15bn deal to merge with Three in a deal that will create the UK�s largest mobile network.

Bosses have said the tie-up is necessary to give the companies enough scale to invest in their networks amid tough competition in the market.

However, it is facing regulatory investigations on national security grounds given Three�s ownership by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison.

The planned merger comes amid increasing scrutiny of the United Arab Emirates�s (UAE) control over Vodafone after the Gulf state last year became Vodafone�s largest shareholder with a 14.6pc stake worth �2.7bn.

Ministers warned last month that Vodafone, which holds sensitive Whitehall contracts and operates vital UK infrastructure including undersea cables, is vulnerable to �material influence� by the UAE.

Margherita Della Valle
Margherita Della Valle took over as Vodafone's chief executive last year - Vodafone
Meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority is expected to launch a review into the proposed tie-up with Three following concerns that it could result in higher prices for consumers.

Vodafone has hired Morgan Stanley and Robey Warshaw, George Osborne�s boutique Mayfair-based investment bank, to advise on the transaction.

The deal is part of a wider structural overhaul being pushed through by chief executive Margherita Della Valle, who said the firm �must change� when she took over the top job last year.

Ms Della Valle has said the company must simplify its sprawling operations as it looks to return to growth. She has also outlined plans to cut 11,000 jobs.

A Vodafone spokesman said: �We have announced a significant number of acquisitions and disposals during this period, including the largest and fourth largest corporate transaction ever � Mannesmann and Verizon Wireless.

�The sale of our stake in Verizon for $130bn included returning $84bn to shareholders.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How much the major broadband providers are increasing their prices by,"Broadband and mobile phone customers can yet again expect to see inflation-based prices rises this April to the tune of 7.9%.

BT, Vodafone, Virgin Media O2 and TalkTalk all use a version of the mechanism, which usually takes the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation � currently at 4% � plus about 3.9%.

However, Virgin Media O2 uses the higher figure of retail price inflation (RPI) taken from the rate published for January.

There have been calls to scrap the controversial above-inflation price rises, particularly amid a cost of living crisis but most operators have stuck to their mid-contract price increases for customers.

Which?'s figures suggested some customers could be paying up to �35 more for their broadband over the next year and up to �27 more for a Sim-only phone contract, after prices rise in April.

Read more: The BBC licence fee is going up. Here's how you can defer the cost

The alternative � paying a fee to exit the contract early � was often much more costly, as much as �339 for some Vodafone customers, Which? said.

How are BT prices changing?
BT is increasing its monthly prices for almost all customers by 7.9% at the end of March 2024.

However, it highlighted that from 'early summer 2024', it will implement a new pricing model while steering away from inflation-based hikes.

How are EE prices changing?
As a subsidiary of BT, EE is also increasing prices by 79% in April.

How are Sky prices changing?
Sky has confirmed broadband and TV bills will be increasing by roughly 6.7% for customers nationwide from April 1, 2024. That means if you pay �50 a month for your broadband and Sky TV, you�ll need to find an extra �40 a year to keep enjoying that same package.

Rocio Concha, Which? director of Policy and Advocacy, said: ""It's very disappointing to see Sky raising prices for customers in this unpredictable way. Consumers deserve pricing certainty rather than being blindsided with more above inflation hikes.

""Unlike people trapped by their contract when prices rise, Sky customers can take action. Customers should send a message to Sky by voting with their feet and taking advantage of their right to exit within 30 days. Our recent research found, on average, Sky TV and broadband customers could save �152 by switching.

""Ofcom's current proposals to ban inflation-linked price rises don't extend to the 'prices may vary' terms that Sky is using for these ad-hoc hikes. The regulator should commit to closing this loophole and banning all forms of unpredictable price rises to protect millions of people.""

How are Vodafone prices changing?
Vodafone confirmed it will increase prices by the December CPI rate plus 3.9%. It said on average, customers will see a rise of �1.50.

This affects almost all of its 1.1 million customers

How are Three prices changing?
Three confirmed that mobile customers will see an average rise of ""less than �1.75 a month"" as it applies a 7.9% rise. The changes will be applied in April.

How are Virgin Media and O2 prices changing?
Virgin Media O2 customers will need to wait a little longer to find out. The company sets its prices based on the RPI figures announced in February.

Can I leave my contract if I don�t agree with the increase?
Unfortunately, no. if you�re within the minimum term of your contract you�re unlikely to be able to avoid these price increases. This is because they're included in the T&Cs.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.

Jim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at ""crossroads"" since there is still ""some inflation"" and the ""dichotomy"" of hard landing versus soft landing is being ""replaced by no landing."" Cramer said that we are ""back to reality"" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still ""not that high."" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.

Don't Wait for Rates Cuts to Invest in the Stock Market, Cramer Says
Jim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem ""reckless"" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be ""too late"" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.

Cramer said ""great"" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that ""5% from CDs"" in ""a week or even a day.""

Cramer as ""No Illusions""
Cramer said that he has ""no illusions"" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.

But Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.

In this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on.

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These Stocks
Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These Stocks
Methodology

For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds� top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

10. Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A

Sports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:

�So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I�ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren�t seeing.�

One of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.

While Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company�s IPO.

While Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

9. Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 9

Last month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to ""take a pass"" on the stock. Cramer said the ""greatest inventor of our time"" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.

8. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15

Surgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said ""that industry is in up and down right now.""

""I'm taking a hard pass,"" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).

Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

�We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors� push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company�s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.�

7. Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22

Jim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn�t ""liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it�s really rewarded my dislike.""

Cramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's ""willing"" to recommend Verizon.

Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).

6. CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24

Gene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.

While Cramer said that he ""likes"" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a ""fundamental basis.""

The stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).

Unlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone and Three merger proposal isn�t as awful as it appears,"Sympathy for Vodafone, viewed over the long term, should be close to zero. This was a company that had the world at its feet at the turn of the century when it made itself global leader in telecoms via an audacious �100bn swoop on Mannesmann in Germany. A few tougher years followed but, even in 2013, Vodafone looked refreshed after the neatly-timed sale of the 45% stake in America�s biggest mobile phone business, Verizon Wireless, for the princely sum of $130bn (then �84bn).

Instead, what�s transpired is a share price that stands now near a 25-year low (Monday�s so-so trading update certainly wasn�t going to move the dial). For the past decade, the Vodafone empire has been in necessary retreat � but slowly. Margherita Della Valle became permanent chief executive in April last year promising to accelerate the deal-making and, to her credit, has announced big moves in two out of three big markets where investors were screaming for action. A disposal in Spain is happening and a merger with Three in the UK has been announced. (The Italian saga is more complicated.)

But should the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), now taking a formal look, allow the deal with Three to go ahead? Until recently, this column�s answer would have been no. There are good reasons why regulators have generally regarded four mobile operators, not three, as the minimum required to deliver effective competition in a market.

Related: Vodafone should spin off sensitive work after UAE deal, say UK officials

Unfortunately, there�s now a fair argument that the �four minimum� analysis isn�t working like it used to. The state of play now in the UK is that the two biggest players, EE (owned by BT) and O2 (owned by Virgin Media and Telefonica), are earning comfortably above a 9%-ish cost of capital, while Vodafone and Three have been well below for years, according to regulator Ofcom�s report in late-2022. That picture does not look like effective competition either. The leaders can pedal softly and invest just enough to maintain their positions, while the third and fourth operators are stuck at the back.

The UK has slipped to last place among G7 economies for average 5G download speeds, according to Opensignal

The set-up doesn�t appear to be doing the UK much good either. The country has slipped to last place among G7 economies for average 5G download speeds, according to the research consultancy Opensignal. BT and Virgin Media, one can speculate, face stronger financial incentives to invest in their fixed-line broadband networks, where the so-called alt-nets are serious irritants. And, given Vodafone�s current sub-par returns in UK mobile, Della Valle would probably be marched out off the door if, in the absence of a cost-spreading combo with Three, she proposed a price-slashing splurge in the UK.

The counter-intuitive reality, then, is that three players might provide more genuine competition. Unlike the Three/O2 combo that was quashed in 2016, we�re talking this time about numbers three and four in the market coming together to fill their networks, the crucial first task in the economics of mobile telephony.

Meanwhile, there is more evidence than in 2016 that mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs that do wholesale deals � think Tesco Mobile and Sky � are here to stay and serve as a brake on prices for consumers. In aggregate, the MVNOs are 17% of the market and EE and O2 dominate as providers.

Vodafone/Three would become number one with 27 million subscribers but, if necessary, regulators could always even things up by enforcing the sale of a portion of spectrum. The main imperative would be to find a mechanism to hold the would-be partners to their pledge to invest �11bn in the UK over 10 years.

It�s true that Vodafone hardly deserves a regulatory helping hand given the financial resources it had at its disposal many years ago. The CMA will also need to be satisfied that the MVNO dynamic is solid. But this may be a moment when pragmatism has to prevail. The deal is not obviously outrageous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vodafone has said it is in talks to sell its Italian business days after it emerged it had rejected an offer by billionaire telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel to merge their Italian operations in a �10.5bn (�9bn) deal.

Chief executive Margherita Della Valle said the company is �in active discussions in Italy� after last week shunning Niel�s Iliad Group, which had tabled a proposal to combine their Italian businesses.

In a trading update, Vodafone revealed revenues slipped by 2.3% in the third quarter to �11.3bn (�9.7bn), although organic service revenue grew 4.7%, ahead of analyst estimates of 4.3%.

It said it remains on track for an underlying annual profit of �13.3bn (�11.4bn).

Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: �Vodafone�s third quarter had some pockets of optimism for investors to cling to. Growth was in line with the second quarter, arguably a better result than some had feared.

Shares in Vodafone dropped over 1% at the start of trading, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) leaderboard, but have since recovered slightly.

Shares in Boeing were lower in premarket trading as the airplane manufacturer discovered new problems with its 737 MAX fuselages and will have to delay delivery of 50 planes to work on them.

According to the Wall Street Journal, a supplier of 737 Max aircraft components discovered misdrilled holes on the fuselages of 50 planes that were in production for the aircraft company.

An employee of Spirit AeroSystems, which creates the fuselage, nacelles, and struts for various Boeing aircraft, alerted their manager to the inaccurate drill holes while the 737 Max planes were making their way through the production process, according to the report.

Separately, Tim Clark, the head of Emirates Airline, said that Boeing�s quality standards have slowly declined for years.

Fears of Chinese influence prompt investigation into �15bn merger of Vodafone and Three,"Vodafone has said it is cooperating with a national security review into its planned �15bn merger with Chinese-owned rival Three.

The telecoms giant last year agreed to merge with Three in a deal that will create the UK�s largest mobile network with more than 27 million customers.

However, the tie-up has attracted scrutiny due to concerns that Three�s Hong Kong-based parent company CK Hutchison could be granted access to sensitive national infrastructure.

Asked if the Government was reviewing the deal under the National Security and Investment Act, Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle said: �Yes absolutely, as with all similar deals we are engaged in the NSA process for the merger between Vodafone and Three.�

Ms Della Valle said both companies had been subjected to �very strict protocol in terms of data protection law [and] telecoms security regulations� and that the review was progressing �as planned�.

She added: �I think it proves the rigorous protocols we are all under and constitutes a model that is applicable for different situations.�

Margherita Della Valle
Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle says both companies had been subjected to �very strict protocol� - Ed Robinson/Vodafone
China-sceptic MPs and union chiefs have raised concerns about the merger with Three due to Vodafone�s sensitive government contracts and network of subsea cables.

Li Ka-shing, the billionaire Hong Kong owner of CK Hutchison, has been accused by Unite of political �collaboration� with the Chinese state.

Both Vodafone and Three have rejected the concerns, arguing that CK Hutchison has been in the UK market for two decades.

In addition to Three, the conglomerate also owns the Port of Felixstowe, health and beauty chain Superdrug, the rolling stock leasing company Eversholt Rail, the electricity distribution infrastructure UK Power Networks and Northumbrian Water.

Ms Della Valle also pointed out that Vodafone will own 51pc of the joint venture, with plans to dilute the Chinese share over time, and will appoint the chief executive.

It comes less than two weeks after a separate government intervention into Vodafone on national security grounds.

Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden ruled the company was at risk of �material influence� by the United Arab Emirates after its state-controlled telecoms operator e& became the largest shareholder in Vodafone with a 14.6pc stake.

Mr Dowden ordered Vodafone to establish a special committee to oversee any work that has a bearing on British security, while bosses will also have to keep officials informed about the partnership with e&.

The UK introduced sweeping new powers under the National Security and Investment Act amid heightened concerns about foreign takeovers of British assets, particularly in sensitive sectors such as telecoms.

Meanwhile, Vodafone�s merger with Three is also under scrutiny on competition grounds amid concerns the deal could push up prices for consumers.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a phase one investigation into the merger as it seeks to examine whether it will lead to a �substantial lessening of competition�.

Vodafone has previously said the deal was subject to approval on both competition and national security grounds.

It came as Vodafone reported a rise in sales in the third quarter as bosses look to push through a turnaround plan to return the company to growth.

Organic service revenue rose 4.7pc in the third quarter to �9.4bn (�8bn) as the company enjoyed growth in most of its markets.

Revenues in Germany, its largest market, grew 0.3pc to �2.9bn. However, this was weaker than the 1.1pc growth posted in the previous quarter as Vodafone rolled out further price rises to 1m customers, sparking some customer losses.

UK revenues grew by more than 5pc as the company gained 18,000 mobile customers, while broadband customers grew by almost 40,000 to 1.3 million.

Vodafone also pointed to strong growth in its business division, while cloud and Internet of Things services grew by a fifth.

Ms Della Valle said: �We�ve made good strategic progress in the first nine months of the year, with improving customer satisfaction and three consecutive quarters of service revenue growth in Europe.�

Karen Egan, head of mobile at Enders Analysis, said the results were �strong on a headline level� but warned the figures were skewed by �erratic� growth in markets such as Italy and Egypt.

Aside from the Three merger, Vodafone is gearing up from a wave of deals across Europe as Ms Della Valle tries to simplify the group�s operations.

The company has inked a �5bn deal to sell its Spanish operations to Zegona Communications.

Vodafone in 'active' Italy deal talks as German recovery slows,"LONDON (Reuters) -Vodafone said on Monday it was in ""active discussions"" about a deal in Italy, its worst performing major market, as it reported a slowdown in growth in its biggest, Germany, in the third quarter.

The British group rejected a merger offer from rival Iliad in Italy last month in favour of pursuing other options.

Sources have said that Vodafone, which last year agreed to merge with Hutchison's Three in Britain and sell its Spanish operation, is exploring a deal with Swisscom's Italian unit Fastweb.

Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said the group was ""engaged in live discussions"" in Italy.

""Our focus remains on delivering the best value creation for Vodafone, as we've done so far in driving consolidation.""

Vodafone reported third-quarter service revenue growth of 4.7%, the same as the previous quarter, as a smaller decline in Spain helped offset the weaker contribution from Germany, where growth slowed from 1.1% to 0.3%.

Della Valle said the German slowdown reflected one-off benefits in the previous quarter.

""The underlying commercial performance is accelerating,"" she said. ""Broadband churn is now behind us and we have great offers in the market supported by superior fixed and mobile networks.""

Italy was the toughest market, with service revenue declining by 1.3% in the third quarter.

Shares in Vodafone, which have fallen 25% in the last 12 months, were trading down 1.2% in early deals.

Analysts at Citi said the update was broadly in line with expectations ""though the slowdown in Germany may be a concern"".

Last month Vodafone said it was in talks with more than one party in Italy, with one source familiar with the matter saying talks with Swisscom were more advanced than others. Swisscom declined to comment at the time.

Vodafone reiterated its full-year guidance for broadly flat adjusted core earnings of around 13.3 billion euros ($14.3 billion), and free cash flow of around 3.3 billion euros.

Analysts, however, are sceptical. They expect on average earnings of 13.07 billion euros and cash flow of 3.13 billion euros, according to a company-complied consensus.

Vodafone rejects �10.5bn merger bid by French billionaire,"Vodafone has rejected an offer by billionaire telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel to merge their Italian operations in a �10.5bn (�9bn) deal.

Mr Niel�s Iliad Group last month tabled a proposal to combine their Italian businesses, arguing the move would help to build scale in an increasingly competitive market.

Following an initial approach, Iliad sweetened the deal by offering to hand an extra �100m in cash to Vodafone and give up a call option that would have allowed it to gain more control over the joint venture over time.

However, Iliad said Vodafone had �failed to accept� the offer, sparking a 4pc drop in the UK company�s share price.

A spokesman for Vodafone added: �We said in December that we are exploring options with several parties in Italy.

�We are no longer in talks with Iliad, but our discussions with others continue.�

One potential suitor that could still strike a deal with Vodafone in Italy is Fastweb, a mobile and broadband provider owned by Swisscom.

Under chief executive Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone has been slimming down its global operations in an effort to pay down debt and return to growth.

The telecoms giant has agreed a �15bn merger in the UK with Three. The deal, which will create the country�s largest mobile network operator, is being reviewed by competition regulators.

Other recent deals include the �5bn sale of its Spanish operations to Zegona Communications.

Vodafone�s rejection in Italy will be a major setback for Mr Niel, a high-profile French businessman who is also a major investor in the newspaper Le Monde. It comes two years after a previous �11bn takeover bid was rebuffed.

Iliad had argued that the merger would create the �most innovative challenger� in Italy, helping to accelerate the rollout of 5G and full-fibre broadband in the country.

Under the improved terms, Vodafone would have gained half the share capital of the combined entity, as well as �6.6bn in cash and a �2bn shareholder loan.

Iliad Italia would have obtained the other half of the share capital, alongside a �400m cash payment and �2bn loan.

Iliad, which owns the Free telecoms brand in France and also operates in Poland, said it was confident the rejected proposal was its strongest possible offer.

The company said it will now pursue a stand-alone strategy in Italy and �fiercely pursue market share gains�.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blue-chip FTSE 100 slipped 0.5%, with heavyweights Shell and BP weighing on the index with a 1% slide, tracking oil prices lower.

UK stocks logged their worst month since October as investors scaled back bets of aggressive interest rate cuts from major central banks, with concerns about China's slowing economy adding to the gloom.

All eyes will be on the Fed, which is widely seen holding interest rates later in the day, with focus on Powell's post-meeting press conference and any hints on how soon the Fed could begin easing rates.

Vodafone rejects Iliad merger in Italy to pursue rival deals,"LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) -Vodafone said it had rejected a sweetened offer from French telecom operator Iliad to merge their Italian businesses and was pursuing other deals in a market where it is losing revenue and makes no return on its capital.

Iliad said on Wednesday the British company had rebuffed a revised 50:50 proposal to create an operator with a combined enterprise value of 14.7 billion euros ($15.9 billion).

Vodafone said in December, after Iliad made its approach public, it was exploring options with several parties, potentially including a merger or a disposal.

One of them was a deal with Swisscom's Fastweb Italian unit, sources familiar with the matter said.

A Vodafone spokesperson said on Wednesday: ""We are no longer in talks with Iliad, but our discussions with others continue.""

Swisscom declined comment.

The talks with Swisscom were more advanced than others, one person with knowledge of the matter said.

Analysts at Citi said Vodafone's rejection of Iliad, founded and majority owned by Xavier Niel, was disappointing.

""A deal with Swisscom's Fastweb could now become the base case,"" they said. ""An inferior outcome in our view.""

Shares in Vodafone, which have fallen 28% in the last 12 months even as it agreed consolidation deals in Spain and Britain, were down about 2.5% in afternoon trading.

A tie-up with Fastweb, which has a fibre network and offers mobile through network-sharing deals, will not face the tough regulatory hurdles as one with Iliad, but it offers lower potential synergies, according to analysts.

A combined Vodafone-Iliad would have become the leader in the Italian market, ahead of Telecom Italia and Hutchison's Wind Tre.

Iliad said its rejected proposal was ""the best possible business combination to benefit a struggling Italian market and telecommunications industry"".

The company, which has grown rapidly in Italy since its arrival in 2018, said it would continue to ""fiercely pursue market share across all segments"" as a standalone operator.

It increased its earlier offer by 100 million euros to 6.6 billion euros in cash, with Vodafone also lined up to receive 2 billion euros of a shareholder loan.

Iliad would have received 400 million euros in cash - 100 million euros less than originally proposed - and also 2 billion euros of a shareholder loan, it said.

The French company offered 11.25 billion euros to buy Vodafone Italy outright in 2022 but was rebuffed. Later that year, Niel took control of a 2.5% stake in Vodafone.

"Vodafone should spin off sensitive work after UAE deal, say UK officials","Vodafone should be forced to spin off its most sensitive activities in order to quash national security concerns raised by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group swooping on its shares, government officials have told the Guardian.

The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, announced on Wednesday that the deal involving Emirates Telecommunications Group building a 14.6% stake in Vodafone presented a �national security risk� to the UK due to Vodafone�s role �as a strategic supplier of services� to government departments, including those �which are in support of national security�.

Dowden said on Friday the government had reached an agreement on measures to manage security risks, without giving details. The government �has put in place proportionate measures to address any potential national security concerns�, he said, adding that the UK was �rightly a magnet for global investment�.

However, officials and sources familiar with operations at Vodafone said breaking off some operations would still be safest for the UK.

Concern is understood to centre on a division called Vodafone Business Security Enhanced (VBSE). It works on some of the most sensitive tech used by the government and its security agencies, sources told the Guardian, including the Ministry of Defence, Foreign Office, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office.

The work is so sensitive that most of VBSE�s government-linked contracts are not publicly listed and some of its staff are vetted to hold high-level security clearance.

The government has not mandated the spin-off of VBSE. However, sources said a full separation might be the best solution to protect the national security functions that VBSE undertakes.

A large proportion of VBSE�s UK workers are based in Hampshire in what the company describes as a �mini-Fort Knox�.

Many of its staff have backgrounds in the military, intelligence services or other sensitive areas of government. Its head, Steve Knibbs, who worked at GCHQ for several years after serving in the British military, also chairs the national security committee of the of industry body TechUK.

Vodafone�s work ranges from mobile networks for civil servants to the ownership and maintenance of subsea cables and services for the UK�s military court service. The service�s hearings are sometimes highly sensitive, involving risks to national security or military operations, and can be held in private. They can also take place anywhere in the world, requiring secure IT support. Defendants and advocates often appear via video link.

The terms of the deal between Vodafone and Emirates Telecoms, also known as e&, allow the latter to add an additional executive to the board if its ownership rises above 20%. It can increase its ownership to nearly 25%.

The Cabinet Office said in a statement on Wednesday that the tie-up would allow e& to �materially influence policy at Vodafone�.

The statement also laid out requirements for Vodafone to set up �a national security committee to oversee sensitive work that Vodafone and its group perform which has an impact on or is in respect of the national security of the United Kingdom�.

Scrutiny has been rising over a range of UK deals backed by the gulf state. This includes the UAE-backed purchase of the Telegraph and Spectator groups. The deal would allow RedBird IMI, which derives most of its funding from Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the UAE and owner of Manchester City football club, to take a controlling stake in the national newspaper and magazine groups.

RedBird IMI has said it would be a �passive investor� once it took ownership of the titles.

The Cabinet Office declined to comment.

A Vodafone spokesperson said: �Vodafone is not considering any change to Vodafone Business Security Enhanced and is not in discussion to spin off the organisation. VBSE is a 24/7 business unit, which has technical operational separation, delivering end-to-end and managed security services to private and public organisations in the UK.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government strikes Vodafone agreement after UAE stake national security fears,"The Government has reached an agreement with Vodafone to address national security concerns related to a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group�s stake in the company.

A number of �proportionate measures� will now be put into place at the London-listed telecoms firm to address concerns and allow it to put a director from the investors on its board.

On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden used new powers to declare there were national security risks related to Emirates Telecommunications Group, which does business as Etisalat by e&, holding an almost 15% stake in Vodafone.


An order cautioned that the relationship e& has with the British firm would �enable it materially to influence the policy of Vodafone� and ordered a �national security committee� to be set up by the business to oversee and monitor any sensitive work.

The Cabinet Office confirmed on Friday it has now approved a new �strategic relationship agreement between Vodafone and e&�.

�Using the National Security & Investment Act it has put in place proportionate measures to address any potential national security concern�, it said on Friday.

�Where investment might impact the UK�s national security � for example through the acquisition of certain technologies or infrastructure � we will work with investment partners to minimise any risk.

�As part of our critical national infrastructure, telecoms is one such sector. Vodafone is also a particularly important company for the UK Government given its critical functions, including as a key partner in HMG�s cyber security strategy.�

A Vodafone spokesman said: �We are pleased to have received clearance in our home market for our strategic relationship agreement with e& and for e& to take a seat on our board.�

Abu Dhabi-listed e& has built up a stake of 14.6% in Vodafone, marking a deepening of a strategic tie-up that began in May 2022 when e& first invested in the FTSE 100 giant.

The British telephone firm announced in May that e& chief executive Hatem Dowidar would join the Vodafone board as a non-executive director.

Earlier on Friday, the UK�s competition watchdog confirmed the proposed merger between Vodafone and fellow mobile network Three is to be formally investigated.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had started the formal investigation to examine whether it could lead to a substantial lessening of competition for mobile consumers by merging the two firms into a single network provider.

The CMA said if it found reason for concern during its initial examination, it could launch a more in-depth investigation into the merger.

The �15 billion merger was first announced last summer and would create the UK�s largest mobile phone network.

It was expected to draw regulator scrutiny, particularly in terms of competition, because it would reduce the major mobile network providers in the UK from four to three.

Trade unions have also criticised the merger over concerns about possible job cuts.

�This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy,� CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said.

�The CMA will assess how this tie-up between rival networks could impact competition before deciding next steps.

�We now have 40 working days to complete this formal phase one investigation, before publishing our findings and any next steps.�

In response to the CMA�s announcement, Vodafone UK chief executive Ahmed Essam said: �We have formally submitted our merger notice to the CMA, having worked with them closely through the pre-notification process. We look forward to continuing the constructive conversations now that the formal process has begun.

�We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players.

�Our commitment to invest �11 billion will build capacity to meet the exponential growth in demand for data and accelerate the rollout of advanced 5G across the UK, delivering benefits to consumers and businesses throughout the nation.

Three UK chief executive Robert Finnegan said: �By combining networks, Three UK and Vodafone UK will unlock �11 billion of investment that will help the UK close the 5G gap with leading European countries and realise its ambitions to be a front-runner in digital connectivity.

�Thanks to this transaction, 95% of the population and every school and hospital will be covered by standalone 5G by the end of the decade.

�Joining forces will also yield more immediate benefits. From day one, our customers will enjoy faster, more reliable coverage over more of the country � and without paying a penny extra.

UK took 'proportionate' steps over Vodafone's Abu Dhabi shareholder -minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said it had put in place ""proportionate measures"" to alleviate its national security concerns about the relationship between Vodafone and Abu Dhabi-based telecoms group e&, explaining its decision to approve the strategic partnership.

The British cleared state-controlled Emirates Telecommunications' 14.6% stake in Vodafone late on Wednesday, but it said the Abu Dhabi-based company's holding posed risks in terms of government contracts and cyber security.

It said Vodafone should take a number of measures to alleviate the risk, including establishing a national security committee to oversee sensitive work that could have an impact on national security.

Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said in a new statement on Friday that the government had put in place ""proportionate measures to address any potential national security concerns"", under tougher rules for foreign investment under a 2021 act.

""The UK is rightly a magnet for global investment and, in this spirit, the Act is entirely country-agnostic,"" he said.

""Where investment might impact the UK�s national security - for example through the acquisition of certain technologies or infrastructure - we will work with investment partners to minimise any risk.""

Related: Virgin Media is most complained about UK broadband provider

In a separate move this week, the government said the stake in Vodafone held by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group posed a national security risk to the UK.

The Cabinet Office issued a notice late on Wednesday warning that the 14.6% stake held by Emirates Telecoms, which is also known as e&, amounted to a security concern given Vodafone�s strategic role in UK telecoms services.

The government has now ordered a �national security committee� to be set up at Vodafone that will oversee and monitor any sensitive work the telecoms firm carries out that could have an impact on national security.

In 2016, the CMA and the European Commission blocked Three�s attempted takeover of O2, arguing that it would have risked higher prices.

However, in 2022 the UK telecoms regulator changed its long-held stance, saying it was now more open to consolidation in the sector. Ofcom had previously argued that dropping to only three networks in a country could harm consumers.

Vodafone UK has a number of government contracts, and Three UK is owned by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, which may raise concerns about foreign joint-ownership of a key national asset, particularly given the city�s status as part of China.

Vodafone UK has public sector contracts with the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, NHS 111 and local police forces.

Ahmed Essam, the chief executive of Vodafone UK, said: �We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players.�

The two companies are the UK�s third and fourth biggest operators respectively. The newly combined company will, if the merger is completed, have more than 27 million subscribers, leapfrogging EE, which is owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2, which is owned by Spain�s Telef�nica and the US-listed company Liberty Global.

The launch of the investigation comes after Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden used new powers to declare there are national security risks in a UAE firm being the major shareholder in Vodafone.

In the order published in Mr Dowden�s name on Wednesday, it says the relationship Emirates Telecommunications Group, which does business as Etisalat by e&, has with the British firm would �enable it materially to influence the policy of Vodafone�.

The senior Conservative ruled that, under powers granted by the National Security and Investment Act, he considered that e&�s stake in Vodafone could cause �a risk to national security� on issues of cybersecurity and in the operator�s role as a �strategic supplier of services to many parts� of government.

Abu Dhabi-listed e& has built up a stake of 14.6% in Vodafone, marking a deepening of a strategic tie-up that began in May 2022 when e& first invested in the FTSE 100 giant.

Coming eight months after that move, Mr Dowden has now imposed conditions, including for Vodafone and e& to �meet certain requirements relating to Vodafone�s board composition� and to �establish a national security committee to oversee sensitive work that Vodafone and its group perform which has an impact on, or is in respect of the national security of the UK�.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spectator chairman urges ministers to block �absurd� Abu Dhabi-backed takeover,"The chairman of The Spectator has said it would be �absurd� for a �dictatorship� to own the right-wing magazine as he rallied against a potential takeover by an Abu Dhabi-backed fund.

Andrew Neil told the BBC he would quit his role with the 200-year-old publication if the takeover goes ahead.

In his first public comments on the proposed deal, the journalist and broadcaster said the potential for The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator to be owned by a group headed up by senior rulers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), an authoritarian Gulf state, �beggars belief� and urged ministers to block the deal.

It comes after Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator, this week warned that preserving a free press �means keeping governments and publications apart�.

Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer has already triggered a Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN) to investigate the potential impact on press freedom if the Daily Telegraph newspaper and The Spectator were taken over by RedBird IMI.

The investment fund is majority-owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, vice president of UAE and owner of Manchester City Football Club.

The fund announced in November it had reached a deal with previous Telegraph owners, the Barclay family, to take control of the newspaper group, and fellow publication The Spectator, by paying off debts owed to their bank, Lloyds.

Ms Frazer�s intervention over press freedom fears led to a review by media regulator Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

They were expected to have their reports to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by Friday containing initial findings about the potential impact of the takeover.

Speaking to BBC�s Newsnight programme, Mr Neil said: �My main concern is that the people bankrolling this are the UAE, the United Arab Emirates.

�They are a government, and the idea that government should own newspapers and magazines in Britain I think is absurd.

�But they are not just a government, they are an undemocratic government � they are a dictatorship.

�The UAE is a terribly successful place � I have done business there � but it is not a democratic government.

�We are a democracy, our publications are part of the democratic process. How could we be owned by an undemocratic government?�

He added: �The Government should be stepping in because we shouldn�t be owned by a foreign government � any kind of government, particularly a dictatorship.�

Mr Neil was also critical of Jeff Zucker, the former CNN executive who is leading the bid.

Mr Zucker told the BBC earlier this month that Sheikh Mansour would be a �passive investor� and said the takeover was �American led�.

Mr Neil called Mr Zucker a �very impressive broadcasting executive� but said he �knows nothing about Britain, he knows nothing about print, he knows nothing about newspapers, and he knows nothing about magazines�.

He continued: �So the idea that these two vital vehicles of mainstream centre-right thought (the Telegraph and Spectator) should be owned by Arab money and controlled out of New York by a left-wing Democrat beggars belief.�

Announcing his plans to quit as chairman if the deal goes ahead, he said: �If RedBird take it over, I�ll be gone.�

A spokesman for RedBird IMI said the fund would not be responding to Mr Neil�s comments.

As the public waits to hear of Ofcom and the CMA�s findings, Ms Frazer signalled this week there could be a further intervention after RedBird announced a new corporate structure.

As part of the new structure, RedBird IMI created a UK-based holding company for the Telegraph newspapers.

Officials have informed the fund that DCMS views that the restructure has created a new relevant merger situation (RMS) which could impact the current process into the potential impact of a takeover deal.

The debate over the press takeover comes as Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden used new powers to declare that there are national security risks in a UAE firm being the major shareholder in telephone operator Vodafone.

UK antitrust regulator begins investigation of Vodafone-Hutchison merger,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's antitrust watchdog has launched an investigation into the $19 billion merger between Vodafone's UK operation and CK Hutchison's Three UK, reviewing whether the deal will hurt competition, it said on Friday.

The tie-up announced last year will reduce the number of mobile networks in Britain from four to three.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has 40 working days to complete its initial investigation, which is likely to lead to an in-depth, phase two probe lasting 24 weeks.

""This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy,"" said CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell.

""The CMA will assess how this tie-up between rival networks could impact competition before deciding next steps.""

The companies pledged to invest 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) to create ""one of Europe's most advanced standalone 5G networks"" in an effort to win over politicians, unions and competition authorities.

Vodafone UK? Chief Executive Ahmed Essam, who will lead the combined group, said consumers would benefit.

""We look forward to continuing the constructive conversations (with the CMA) now that the formal process has begun,"" he said.

Regulators have previously blocked some deals that reduce the number of networks from four to three.

A 2016 British merger between Three UK and Telefonica's O2 was stopped by the European Commission because it was considered likely to result in higher prices.

After Brexit, it will be up to the CMA to rule on the Vodafone-Three deal.

Last year the CMA blocked Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard but later approved the deal after reopening the case.

The CMA could block the Vodafone deal or accept it, with or without remedies. Cardell said in November that the CMA preferred structural remedies.

"UAE stake in Vodafone is a threat to Britain, ministers find","The United Arab Emirates� stake in the telecoms operator Vodafone is a threat to Britain�s national security, ministers have found.

Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden intervened to demand protection from the Gulf state after it became Vodafone�s biggest shareholder with a 14.6pc shareholding worth �2.7bn.

Mr Dowden ruled that Vodafone, which holds sensitive Whitehall contracts and owns critical infrastructure including undersea cables, was at risk of �material influence� by the UAE.

He ordered the company to establish a special committee to oversee any work that has a bearing on British security.

Vodafone will also be required to keep officials informed about its partnership with e&, the UAE�s state telecoms operator. Its executives will only be allowed to take non-executive positions at Vodafone.

The partnership was first agreed by the companies almost a year ago. UAE telecoms chief Hatem Dowidar was granted a seat on the Vodafone board, with an option to nominate a second director if the stake is increased above 20pc.

Mr Dowden�s intervention, made under the recently introduced and sweeping powers of the National Security and Investment Act, comes as ministers also scrutinise an Abu Dhabi-funded takeover of The Telegraph.

Ofcom is investigating whether the deal is a threat to press freedom. Senior Conservatives have demanded a parallel scrutiny of the potential threat to national security, but there has been no announcement. However, such investigations are often not disclosed until they have been completed.

The regulator is currently reviewing the deal�s impact on press freedom and had been scheduled to report back to the Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer by Friday, though this deadline could be pushed back after RedBird IMI told officials it had created a new corporate structure under which it intended to own The Telegraph.

The UAE�s swoop on Vodafone was part of a wave of oil-rich Gulf states buying into sensitive industries in the West, which sparked alarm among some security officials.

Saudi Arabia�s move to take a 9.9pc stake in the Spanish equivalent of BT, Telefonica, in December prompted ministers in Madrid to buy a 10pc stake in a company which was privatised in 1997.

In the United States, national security officials are vetting a string of takeovers by Abu Dhabi investors over fears about the UAE�s ties to China. It was revealed in November that the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), a secretive group which scrutinises foreign takeovers of US companies, was conducting the work.

Officials are concerned that takeovers of sensitive US assets from funds in the Gulf could harm national security because of China�s growing influence in the region. UAE has fostered closer relations with China and Russia in recent months.

Deals involving Abu Dhabi funds are viewed as particularly worthy of scrutiny because investment decisions are made by a small band of royals. The planned takeover of The Telegraph is 75pc funded by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice president of the UAE.

The Gulf state�s telecoms operator has been accused of tricking BlackBerry users into installing spyware by telling them it was a software update.

The company also operates internet censorship software in the UAE that blocks access to websites that fall short of the country�s moral and religious values, including pornography and material that promotes gay rights.

Mr Dowden decided the measures were �necessary and proportionate to mitigate the risk to national security�.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: �The National Security and Investment regime enables the UK to continue championing open investment, whilst protecting national security. �

A spokesman for Vodafone said: �We are pleased to have received clearance in our home market for our strategic relationship agreement with e&, and for e& to take a seat on our board.�

Sir Alec Shelbrooke, a Tory MP and former defence procurement minister, said: �It is welcome news that the Government is keeping an oversight on takeovers of essential communication assets.

�A respected national newspaper must be considered a national asset, and therefore its ownership should never be part of a foreign government. It is essential that the Government considers the national security implications of the UAE buying The Telegraph.�

e&'s Hatem Dowidar

Neil O�Brien, former health minister, added: �If the Government regards UAE as a security risk even just carrying our telecoms then that has pretty clear implications for their ability to run our newspaper and magazines.

�It is concerning that there are last-minute attempts to rejig their complex corporate ownership structure in its move for The Telegraph in order to circumvent regulation. I hope the Government will stand up to this.

�While we want to have a friendly relationship with the UAE, them coming to own our media is likely to lead to many unwelcome questions for Abu Dhabi. It would be perfectly reasonable for the Government to call this in on national security grounds.�

Scrutiny over Vodafone�s relationship with the UAE will also raise further questions about the telecoms giant�s planned �15bn merger of its UK business with rival Three.

That transaction may also face a review on national security grounds due to Three�s ownership by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison.

Concerns around that deal are also focused on Vodafone�s government contracts, as well as its network of sensitive subsea cables. The deal will also be reviewed on competition grounds amid concerns it could push up prices for consumers.

Vodafone and Three are understood to have formally submitted their merger notice to the Competition and Markets Authority and the watchdog is expected to launch a phase one investigation shortly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UAE telco's stake in Vodafone poses some security risks, UK says","LONDON (Reuters) -An Abu Dhabi-based telecoms company's stake in mobile group Vodafone poses national security risks in terms of government contracts and cyber security, Britain has concluded, ordering Vodafone to take steps to manage the risks.

In a statement published on Jan. 24, the UK government cleared state-controlled Emirates Telecommunications' 14.6% stake in Vodafone, which makes it the British firm's largest shareholder.

However, the government said Vodafone should establish a national security committee to oversee sensitive work that could have an impact on national security.

It also limited the functions that an e& representative can undertake on Vodafone's board, without giving more details.

Fears that foreign powers could meddle in key British businesses have prompted the government to step up scrutiny of corporate transactions involving state-owned buyers and companies from authoritarian countries.

Britain is also scrutinising an Abu Dhabi-backed group's takeover plan for Britain's Telegraph newspaper.

E&, which has operations in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa, has built up a stake in Vodafone since an initial investment in May 2022 and the two companies agreed to deepen their relationship in May 2023.

Vodafone said then that e&'s chief executive Hatem Dowidar would join its board as a non-executive director.

A Vodafone spokesperson said on Thursday: ""We are pleased to have received clearance in our home market for our strategic relationship agreement with e&, and for e& to take a seat on our board.""

The strategic partnership is still awaiting clearance in a number of other jurisdictions.

E& did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares in Vodafone were trading down 1.2% in early afternoon deals.

Britain said the risk arose in relation to Vodafone's roles in supplying communications to many parts of central government and in ensuring the country's cyber security.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soaring broadband prices: your rights and how to fight back,"Broadband and mobile phone bills will rise by an inflation-busting 7.9pc for millions of customers this spring.

Most operators � including BT, Three, EE and Vodafone � are bringing in another wave of price rises in April, increasing the average annual bill by �27 per year.

Even those mid-contract are not immune to the increases, which are determined by December�s consumer prices index (CPI) inflation figures.
Inflation stands at 4pc but most internet providers add a further 3.9 percentage points to this � taking the overall increase to 7.9pc.
Last year, customers were lumped with price rises of up to 14.4pc, leading to telecoms companies coming under greater scrutiny over contract pricing.
Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, is considering banning inflation-linked price hikes but this has not stopped this year�s round of crippling increases.

Which providers are increasing broadband and mobile costs
BT this week said it would scrap its policy of linking price increases to inflation, but stopped short of reigning in a 7.9pc rise this April.
The changes � which will see monthly payments rise by a minimum of �1.50 and �3 for mobile and broadband users respectively each year � will come into effect next year.
EE, Vodafone and Three will each bring in the 7.9pc increase.

Virgin Media and O2 use January�s Retail Prices Index (RPI), plus 3.9 percentage points, to determine their price increases. We�ll know what they will be next month.

TalkTalk is bringing in a slightly lower 7.7pc increase. Sky Broadband, meanwhile, doesn�t set pricing based on inflation, but increases are expected to be announced soon. Last year�s rise of 8pc was considerably lower than other providers.

Despite the widespread nature of inflation-linked contracts, the majority of people said they did not understand inflation measures such as consumer price inflation and retail price inflation, and were unable to identify the increases in their own contracts, according to an Ofcom survey.

What are the best broadband deals?
Based on a London postcode:

Vodafone Fibre 2: 67MB, 24-month contract, �0 upfront costs, �50 gift card. �24 per month. New Vodafone customers only. Offer ends 21/01.

Source: comparethemarket.com. T&Cs apply to all the deals. Monthly prices are subject to increase each April in line with the Consumer Price Index rate of inflation.

Can I cancel mid-term?
If your contract does not explicitly set out these increases, then you should be able to leave without paying the exit fee � which can be hundreds of pounds.

Just be sure to discuss this with your provider first. If this isn�t satisfactory, or takes longer than eight weeks, you can refer the matter for free to the communications ombudsman.

If you�re signed up to a fixed deal and want to cancel your internet contract at any point, you�ll need to give 30 days� notice.

Ending your deal mid-contract will probably mean paying an early termination penalty, which could be hefty if there�s still a lot of time left on your contract.

When you initially sign up for a broadband contract, there�s usually a 14-day cooling-off period which allows you to cancel without penalty.

How to haggle for a better-priced deal
There are more options available to those coming to the end of a contract.

It is usually a bad idea to stay with a company for too long � �price walking� is rife and better deals are often available at operators seeking to entice new customers.

However, you could end up with a substandard product if you only consider price, so also weigh up what you want in speed, reliability and customer service.

If you�d prefer not to go through the upheaval of swapping providers, it might be worth haggling with your current one. Broadband is a large but fiercely competitive marketplace, and companies will often hand out sweeteners to keep customers on-side.

Holding out can pay dividends � data from Which? shows that the average haggler saved �43 a year. Be sure to highlight the issues you�ve had with your provider and any better offers that you�ve spotted.

What if my broadband speed is slow?
If your broadband speed is much slower than what your provider estimated, you are within your rights to request an affordable and decent connection.

But it�s important to understand the difference between your internet speed and WiFi speed.

Your provider�s minimum speed guarantee refers to internet speeds for devices with a wired connection to your router, using an ethernet cable, rather than relying on WiFi.

Most of the bigger internet providers have signed up to the Ofcom voluntary code. This means they must help you with your speed issues, and if your speed remains below your guaranteed minimum, they must let you leave your contract without incurring a penalty charge.

Alternatively, you may be given the option to continue the contract, but at a lower monthly cost.

What if I move house?
Uswitch says most providers will have dedicated teams to make it easy for you to transfer your broadband to your new home as long as you give 30 days� notice, or in some instances, two weeks� warning.

If you�re mid-contract, you may be able to leave for free if you move to a new area and your current provider is unable to supply a connection.

But this may not always be the case. Uswitch says that if you were still within your initial contract period, you would have to pay an early termination fee to cancel, even if you weren�t able to continue that service at your new address.

What to consider when finding a broadband deal
Price

Comparing prices across the many broadband deals available is essential if you�re looking for good value for money. Many sites offer comparison services, including the Telegraph.

You might find that certain providers offer fast speeds for a lower price than their competitors. If you�re on a budget, opting for a cheap deal is possible � you just need to do your research.

Availability

Most households fall into one of three categories of internet connection, technically called: ADSL, VDSL or FTTP.

You can enter your postcode on Ofcom�s website to check the connection quality in your area. If you live in the countryside, ADSL, the slowest, may be the only connection available to your property.

Internet speeds

No one wants slow broadband speeds, particularly in busy households with high usage. Take a look at the broadband speeds available in your area and consider which is the minimum speed you realistically need for a good internet connection.

Internet speed is measured in megabits per second (Mbps) and the average broadband speed in the UK is 86.5Mbps

Basic functions, such as browsing the internet and checking emails, usually require 1 to 2Mbps, but for video streaming you�ll need more � particularly if you want to watch in high definition.

Netflix recommends a minimum broadband speed of 3Mbps to watch programmes in HD, 5Mbps for Full HD and 15Mbps for 4k/UHD.

Video conferencing usually requires minimum speeds of between 3 and 4Mbps. Most games consoles recommend at least 3Mbps for online play, but data-intensive games can require speeds of over 100Mbps to avoid lag.

Contract length

Users are typically bound to a contract for 12, 18 or 24 months.

Some longer contracts have lower monthly costs, so they could be worthwhile if you don�t mind tying yourself down for longer.

Some providers offer a 30-day rolling contract, which is perfect if you want a flexible, commitment-free broadband plan, as ending it only means seeing out the last 30-day period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK mobile and broadband customers face price hikes of 8% as inflation rises,"Millions of mobile and broadband customers face price rises of about 8% after the shock increase in inflation in December.

Most of the main operators have bill rises written into contracts that are linked to the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation for December. Typically the increases are CPI plus 3.9 percentage points, which means price rises of 7.9%.

The increase is lower than last year, when the practice led to rises of up to 17.3%, which the Guardian highlighted risked fuelling the cost of living crisis.

Related: UK inflation: which goods and services have changed most in price?

It could also be the last time that inflation is used in operators� calculations, as in December the regulator, Ofcom, proposed banning index-linked rises, saying they were too confusing for consumers.

On Tuesday, BT become the first big telecoms company to scrap the inflation-linked price rises for mobile and broadband customers, although not before pushing through a final increase this year.

Its customers will pay 7.9% more from April.

Vodafone and Three have both confirmed that they will pass on rises outlined in current contracts, which also means a 7.9% rise this year.

Vodafone said the change would affectabout half of its customers, who could expect an increase of �a few pounds a month�.

Three said the average price rise was less than �1.50 a month.

A Vodafone spokesperson said: �We know no one likes to see prices rise, but, like all industries, we face inflationary pressures that raise the cost of running and investing in our network.�

They said the company supported Ofcom�s work, and added: �We have a strong presence in the non-contract market which doesn�t see price rises, and our support of vulnerable customers won�t change � we freeze prices for those registered as financially vulnerable and for those on our mobile or broadband social tariffs.�

Other mobile companies have not yet announced whether they plan to go through with the increases.

The consumer group Which? said it would be �completely unacceptable� if providers went through with inflation-linked rises.

Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: �This announcement could trigger a new wave of price hikes from big broadband and mobile providers � just 12 months after many firms imposed price increases of more than 14% on customers.

�It would be completely unacceptable for providers to follow BT and inflict another above-inflation increase on customers after Ofcom proposed banning this practice, saying it causes substantial consumer harm.

�Telecoms providers must step up and do the right thing by immediately scrapping any plans to hit their customers with above-inflation price hikes this April.�

Virgin Media bases its increases on the typically higher RPI inflation rate and uses January�s figure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg sees AI as big part of network growth,"Artificial intelligence, and its need to move and process vast amounts of data, will be a core focus for Verizon Communications (VZ) in 2024 and beyond.

In an exclusive sit-down at the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Verizon chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg outlined his AI vision for the company with Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi.

�When it comes to AI, especially the generative AI and things like that, I think at the edge of the network it will be very important to have AI to make quick decisions very close to the end user,� Vestberg said, adding that the company has already built �enormously strong resilience� into its data network.

""Network strength, the ability to power the processes and movements of AI-generated activity � AI will be important for future business growth,"" Vestberg added.

European telecom giant Vodafone (VOD) announced a 10-year partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday, which will bring generative AI and other services to its consumers and businesses. One area of use will be customer service, where Microsoft's AI chatbots will help provide more intelligent responses to questions.

Verizon is also working on providing more AI services, says Vestberg. ""You can not only expect we're working with all these players in order to see the customer get the best of us, and there is many different [aspects] we need to work with because we have different type of operating system and devices.""

As generative AI applications become more commonplace they may also revive a flagging smartphone market, which has been stagnating as users go longer and longer between upgrades.

""Every new innovation attracts new players in the market and new devices,"" says Vestberg, who compares AI to the launch of 5G connectivity, which spurred a need for new phones.

While mum about the company�s upcoming quarterly results, Vestberg did note that Verizon has been shifting its focus away from the saturated consumer market and more towards the enterprise market, where it expects to see continued demand. Its broadband services have become an essential good, particularly as the need for online education, telehealth, and other remote services increase.

Verizon will report its fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 23. The company is expected to have earned $1.07 a share vs. $1.19 a share in the year-earlier period, according to the average of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone to use Microsoft generative AI after signing �1.2bn deal,"Vodafone has signed a 10-year, billion-pound deal with Microsoft that will see the telecoms firm use Microsoft�s generative AI, digital and cloud services.

The deal will see Vodafone invest 1.5 billion dollars (�1.2 billion) over the next 10 years in customer-facing generative AI using Microsoft�s technologies, as well as digitise its data centres using the US firm�s Azure cloud platform.

It will see the latest generative AI technology used to create chatbots to be used across Vodafone customer services, the companies said.

In announcing the new partnership, Microsoft and Vodafone said the deal would help more than 300 million consumers and businesses across Europe and Africa.

As part of the deal, Microsoft will use Vodafone�s fixed and mobile connectivity services and will invest in the telecoms firm�s connected devices platform � which will become a standalone business by April 2024, the companies said.

Vodafone Group chief executive Margherita Della Valle said: �Today, Vodafone has made a bold commitment to the digital future of Europe and Africa.

�This unique strategic partnership with Microsoft will accelerate the digital transformation of our business customers, particularly small and medium-sized companies, and step up the quality of customer experience for consumers.�

Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said: �This new generation of AI will unlock massive new opportunities for every organisation and every industry around the world.

�We are delighted that together with Vodafone we will apply the latest cloud and AI technology to enhance the customer experience of hundreds of millions of people and businesses across Africa and Europe, build new products and services, and accelerate the company�s transition to the cloud.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UPDATE 1-Vodafone signs $1.5 bln Microsoft deal for AI, cloud and IoT","LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Vodafone has agreed a 10-year partnership with Microsoft to bring generative AI, digital, enterprise and cloud services to more than 300 million businesses and consumers across its European and African markets.

The British company will invest $1.5 billion in customer-focused AI developed with Microsoft's Azure OpenAI and Copilot technologies, it said, and will replace physical data centres with cheaper and scalable Azure cloud services.

Microsoft will in turn become an equity investor in Vodafone's managed IoT (Internet of Things) platform when it is spun out as a standalone business by April, and help scale Vodafone's mobile financial platform in Africa.

Vodafone's Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle, who is under pressure to return the group to profit growth, has identified an opportunity to help businesses digitise, noting in May that the addressable market was worth 140 billion euros.

She said the deal, which she signed with Microsoft's Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, would ""accelerate the digital transformation of our business customers, particularly small and medium-sized companies"".

Vodafone's Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said Microsoft's leadership in AI, underpinned by its OpenAI partnership, would transform the telco's customer services.

""That's the part that is really going to catch each and every one of our customers,"" he said on Tuesday, adding that a Microsoft AI-underpinned TOBi chatbot would provide more consistent and intelligent responses to queries.

The technology would help Vodafone's customer service staff improve productivity and the quality of their conversations, the company said, rather than replacing them with AI.

Microsoft's Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff said Vodafone's strength in IoT and financial services were strategically important.

""The IoT assets are critical in helping us address the sustainability needs of so many of our customers in hard-to-abate sectors,"" he said.

Microsoft deploys ""digital twins"" to model manufacturing environments so that process improvements can be tested in the cloud.

""Vodafone's IoT stack allows us to go into those environments, model the environment, create large-scale data stores, and use AI to help customers meet their sustainability goals,"" he said.

Vodafone's M-PESA mobile money platform, which operates in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and other African countries, shared the same objectives as Microsoft in the region, such as building digital literacy.

""We are excited to bring generative AI capabilities to help customers make more intelligent financial decisions,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three�s �2bn dividend payout sparks row over Vodafone merger,"A record �2bn dividend payment to the owners of the telecoms firm Three sparked a row over the weekend as it was claimed that the huge payout showed that the company was profiteering and that its planned merger with Vodafone was �a clear attack on consumers�.

The Unite union said the dividend paid to the Hong Kong-listed conglomerate of the billionaire Li Ka-shing, which owns Three, revealed that the firm was highly profitable as an independent business and could remain viable without a merger.

If the merger is given the green light by UK regulators, competition will mainly be between Virgin Media O2, EE/BT and Vodafone/Three.

Hutchison 3G, which trades as Three and has 10 million customers and more than 4,500 employees in the UK, said the dividend payment followed the �10bn sale to Cellnex of mobile phone masts across Europe, which included 6,600 UK assets. The agreement with Cellnex was a one-time transaction that sold off the passive infrastructure of Three sites on which it now pays rent.

A spokesperson added that it had also invested heavily in the UK business and the rollout of 5G mobile technology for its customers. It is the first dividend payment by the company.

However, Unite said the dividend payment, shown in the company�s latest accounts, was made months before Three increased some of its contract prices by 14%.

With fewer competitors, the increase in prices might have been even higher, the union said.

The British company is owned by 95-year-old Li�s CK Hutchison Holdings, which has come under fire in the past for dividends taken from its other UK assets, including �2bn of dividends from the electricity distribution business UK Power Networks.

In 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the European Commission blocked Three�s attempted takeover of O2, which would have left just three major networks, saying it would have risked higher prices. The two companies had attempted to allay concerns by assuring regulators they would freeze prices for UK consumers for five years.

Hutchison 3G has pledged to increase investment as part of its latest merger scheme, which would allow Li to cash out of a business he launched 20 years ago.

The deal is likely to be scrutinised by the CMA, although last year the UK telecoms regulator, Ofcom, changed its long-held stance, saying it was now more open to consolidation in the sector. It had previously argued that dropping to only three networks could harm consumers.

Unite�s spokesperson, Sarah Carpenter, said: �The siphoning of record dividends from Three while crying �failing firm� to push through the harmful Vodafone merger is nothing short of cynical exploitation.�

Unions fear higher charges will be followed by huge job losses if the merger is waved through.

�This deal is a clear attack on consumers, threatening a staggering �350 hike in yearly mobile bills and putting 2,500 jobs on the line, while making hollow promises about future investments,� Carpenter said.

�On top of that, entrusting vital blue light [emergency services] contracts to a Chinese state-influenced company raises alarming national security concerns. Unite continues to stand firm against this merger, fighting to protect the interests of workers, consumers and the broader public.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Surging bills prompt people to keep mobile phones for longer,"Mobile phones are being kept for longer as surging bills force consumers to be more savvy with their spending.

The average length of smartphone ownership now stands at 2.8 years, up from 2.6 years this time last year, according to new data.

More than 30pc of UK consumers have owned their smartphones for more than three years � an increase of more than a fifth.

Both EE-owner BT and Virgin Media O2 have reported a decline in smartphone sales in recent months as consumers tighten their purse strings.

Jack Hamlin, global consumer insights director at Kantar�s Worldpanel division, who studied the data, put the trend down to �sticky� inflation in the UK.

�Inflation may be slowing now, but reduced household savings and rising credit card defaults are set to further squeeze consumers� wallets into 2024,� he said.

�In response, inflation-battered consumers are changing their behaviour. Smartphones are being held onto for longer and are increasingly only being replaced when they break.�

The UK�s mobile networks � EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three � all rolled out inflation-busting price rises in April, hiking bills by as much as 15pc in April.

The lack of clarity over price rises has sparked anger among many consumers and prompted regulator Ofcom to step in.

In a further blow, the weakness of the pound has left British consumers paying more for their devices.

While overall smartphone prices have levelled out in recent years, many manufacturers have begun to price devices at the same figure in dollars, euros and pounds.

Mr Hamlin added: �What that means is UK consumers are getting a worse deal � they�re having to pay more for their devices versus their US and European counterparts.�

Higher costs mean an increasing number of customers are also choosing to buy devices SIM-free, rather than purchasing them from a mobile operator in a contract bundle.

The proportion of consumers opting for this tactic stood at 52pc in the year to October, up from 46pc in the previous 12 months.

Kantar said this was helping to boost the market share of so-called mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) such as GiffGaff, Voxi and Lebara, which piggy-back off the networks of larger players.

Meanwhile, established players are overhauling their business models in a bid to stand out in an increasingly competitive telecoms market.

In October, EE said it will begin selling fridges and insurances as it broadens its offering to appeal to more customers.

Vodafone and Three are also in talks over a �15bn merger that would create the UK�s largest mobile network. The companies have said the tie-up is needed to give them the firepower to invest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks To Buy,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable cheap stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest happenings in the renewable energy industry, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks To Buy.

As investors seek to exit 2023 with the hopes of interest rates coming down, the stock market of today is quite different from the one before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2022 mega inflation cycle, and the pre-coronavirus pandemic era. Interest rates in the U.S. now sit at record high levels for the 21st century, and they have naturally impacted the stock market and its valuations.

One of the most basic ways in which a stock, or even the entire market, is valued is the price to earnings ratio. This ratio measures the premium that investors pay for a firm over its ability to generate bottom line profit, and a higher ratio implies a higher valuation. So when rates are high, investors demand a higher premium for the opportunity cost of parking capital in interest paying securities, and naturally, this leads to depressed demand for stocks that ends up reducing their valuations.

For the prudent investor, this reduction can also present a buying opportunity if the bets are correctly timed. Lower valuations due to monetary policy are mostly unrelated to a firm's underlying fundamentals. Consequently, there is potential for them to 'self correct' should the economic environment improve to provide investors with an opportunity to book a profit.

This became quite clear in December 2023 after the latest comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The central bank has raised interest rates to 5.25%, and with the year coming to a close, anything that anyone can talk about is when the rates will start to drop. Well, Mr. Powell's latest statements warned against the perils of keeping rates too high for too long, and as a result, stock markets soared across the board. For the week ending on December 15th, the S&P 500 gained 2.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) soared by 2.9%, and the NASDAQ Composite posted 2.8% in returns as valuations started to adjust due to hopes of lower interest rates.

In fact, the Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged was quite good for the S&P 500 as the flagship benchmark stock index went on to touch a 23 week high of 4738 points. This came right when billions of dollars poured into equity funds as investors were in no mood to wait and miss out on returns after confidence in a dovish Fed grew. During the week, $2 billion made its way into U.S. equity funds, with technology and high growth stocks leading the charge.

But what about the economy? After all, while interest rates are naturally quite relevant to stock valuations, so is the economic picture. The stock market is a risky investment vehicle and one that sees funds flow only if the economy is expected to perform to expectations. One of the biggest debates that has stemmed from the Fed's rapid interest rate hikes is whether they carry the potential to tip America into a recession. Should this be the case, then the market will naturally drop, so it's important to understand where the economy will head next year as the interest rate hikes feed their way into the system.

On this front, data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is quite relevant. Its latest report estimates that GDP growth in the U.S. will slow down to 1.4% in 2024 after posting 2.5% for the full year 2023. The 2.5% figure for this year is an upward revision from the CBO's previous estimate of 0.9% for a rather sizeable revision. When it comes to inflation, the CBO believes that the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index will sit at 2.1% in 2024, just 0.1% higher than the Fed's preferred reading of 2% due to better supply chains. Finally, it also estimates that the economy will grow by 2.2% in 2025 - a noticeable gain but a downward revision from an earlier 2.4% nevertheless.

Octopus Energy achieves �6.2bn valuation after raising �625m from investors,"Octopus Energy has boosted its valuation to $8bn (�6.3bn) after raising $800m from investors.

Britain�s second-largest gas and electricity supplier said it plans to use the cash to fuel its global expansion and grow its heat pump business, as it aims to capitalise on the Government�s push for net zero.

In its latest round of fundraising, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has pledged $326m, while Australia�s Origin Energy added $305m.

Two other investors are contributing to maintain their existing percentage stake: Tokyo Gas, the largest natural gas utility company in Japan; and Generation Investment Management, which was founded by the former US vice-president Al Gore and positions itself as a net-zero investor.

In a previous fundraising round two years ago, the company was valued at �4bn.

By comparison, British Gas owner Centrica is currently valued at �7.7bn on the London Stock Exchange.

An industry source told The Telegraph that Octopus had already overtaken Centrica as the biggest supplier of electricity in the UK, but that it was not interested in becoming market leader in gas because it saw heat pumps as the future.

Greg Jackson, the Octopus chief executive, said: �We will invest to accelerate our growth and create a truly global clean energy giant.�

Frank Calabria, the chief executive of Origin Energy, said that since its initial investment in May 2020, Octopus had �exceeded all expectations and cemented our belief in its unique capabilities and strong platform for future growth�.

The company has started to install heat pumps in the UK this year, while also manufacturing its own models. This comes as the Government plans to ban traditional gas boilers from new-built houses from 2025 and looks for ways to hit net zero emissions by 2050.

Octopus says the investment will help create 3,000 �green jobs� in the UK next year, including 2,000 engineers installing heat pumps, with the remainder in sales and administration.

The business was founded in 2015 but has grown rapidly to serve more than 5m UK households.

At the start of December it completed its acquisition of 1.3m Shell Energy customers in the UK and Germany. It has also been appointed by Ofgem to be the �supplier of last resort� for customers served by a string of energy companies that have become insolvent over the past three years.

The company�s tentacles have expanded into rival domestic energy companies, with its Kraken computer system being adopted by E.On, EDF and Good Energy.

Earlier this month, it secured a �550m funding facility from Lloyds Bank for its electric vehicle leasing business, which works with 4,000 companies.

Octopus now operates in 18 countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billionaire telecoms tycoon plots Italian marriage to Vodafone,"Billionaire telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel is plotting a �10.5bn (�9bn) Italian merger with Vodafone as network operators push for scale in an increasingly competitive market.

Mr Niel�s Iliad Group has tabled a proposal to Vodafone to combine their Italian businesses, creating what would be the �most innovative challenger� in the country.

Iliad said the tie-up would accelerate the rollout of full-fibre broadband and 5G in Italy with a combined group of five mobile network operators and more than 10 broadband providers.

The proposed deal would value Vodafone Italia at �10.45bn. The London-listed company would gain half the share capital of the combined entity, as well as �6.5bn in cash and a �2bn shareholder loan.

Iliad Italia would obtain the other half of the share capital, alongside a �500m cash payments and �2bn loan.

Iliad would also have a call option to acquire additional share blocks of 10pc each year. If it were to buy out the entire company, this would hand a further �2bn to Vodafone.

Shares in Vodafone jumped more than 7pc after the proposed deal was announced.

The approach suggests Mr Niel is ramping up the pressure on Vodafone almost two years after a previous �11bn Italian takeover bid was rejected.

The 56-year-old billionaire owns the Free telecoms brand in France, while Iliad also operates in Poland.

An influential figure in his home country, Mr Niel is also a major investor in newspaper Le Monde. In September, he bought Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky�s stake in the business and will transfer the shares to an independent foundation as part of a plan to guarantee editorial independence.

However, the tycoon faces competition in his bid for Vodafone Italia. The company is reportedly also in discussions about a potential deal with Fastweb, a mobile and broadband provider owned by Swisscom.

Any deal between Iliad and Vodafone is likely to be reviewed by competition regulators in Brussels.

Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle

The proposed merger comes as Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle looks to slim down the company�s sprawling operations and pay down debt.

The company has struck a �15bn deal with Three to create the UK�s largest mobile network, although the deal is facing scrutiny from competition regulators, as well as a potential review on national security grounds.

In October, Vodafone sold its Spanish operations to Zegona Communications for �5bn.

Ms Della Valle has also outlined plans to cut 11,000 jobs as she admitted the company�s performance �has not been good enough�. Around 2,700 of those cuts took place in the first half of this year.

Iliad said the combined Italian company would generate profits of around �1.6bn on revenues of �5.8bn. It added that the merger would create �600m in cost savings.

Karen Egan, head of mobile at Enders Analysis, described the implied valuation of Vodafone Italia as �really quite attractive in today�s market�.

She added: �[Iliad] will definitely be conscious that Vodafone shareholders want action and they want to take advantage of that.�

Thomas Reynaud, Iliad chief executive, said: �The market context in Italy calls for the creation of the most innovative telecom challenger, with ability to compete and create value in a competitive environment.

�We believe that the profiles and complementary expertise of Iliad and Vodafone in Italy would allow us to build a strong operator with the ability and financial strength to invest for the long term.

�NewCo would be fully committed to accelerating the country�s digital transformation and especially fibre adoption and 5G deployment, with more than �4bn of investment planned over the next five years.�

Vodafone said: �Consistent with its previous statements, Vodafone is supportive of in-market consolidation in countries where it is not achieving appropriate returns on invested capital and confirms it is exploring options with several parties to achieve this in Italy, including through a merger or a disposal.

�There can be no certainty that any transaction will ultimately be agreed. If required, a further announcement will be made when appropriate.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone shares climb as Iliad proposes Italian merger,"MILAN/LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -Iliad said on Monday it had submitted a proposal to Vodafone to merge their Italian units, a move that would combine its fast-growing consumer base with the British company's strength in business in a highly competitive market.

Shares in Vodafone, which said last month it was reviewing options in Italy, rose 6.6% on the joint-venture proposal, which Reuters first reported on Friday.

The French company's move comes as Vodafone also explores a potential deal with Swisscom's Fastweb Italian unit, sources familiar with the matter said.

Operators in Italy are studying ways to consolidate a market grappling with shrinking revenue and margins, which is depriving investors of returns on their capital.

Vodafone said it noted Iliad's offer, which would create a company with an enterprise value of 14.9 billion euros ($16.3 billion) and had the backing of Iliad's board and its main shareholder Xavier Niel.

""Vodafone is supportive of in-market consolidation in countries where it is not achieving appropriate returns on invested capital and confirms it is exploring options with several parties to achieve this in Italy, including through a merger or a disposal,"" it said.

Under the plan, Vodafone would receive 6.5 billion euros in cash and a 50% stake. It would also receive a shareholder loan of 2.0 billion euros to ensure long-term alignment, Iliad said.

Iliad, which will receive 500 million euros and an identical shareholder loan, would have an option to buy a further block of 10% of shares each year at the price when the deal closes.

The French company offered 11.25 billion euros to buy Vodafone Italy outright last year but was rebuffed. Later that year, Niel took control of a 2.5% stake in Vodafone.

The two companies had been in talks for some time before Iliad made its proposal public on Monday, one person familiar with the matter said, but sticking points included governance and which company would appoint the chief executive.

BIGGER SAVINGS

A tie-up with Fastweb, which has a fibre network and offers mobile through network-sharing deals, would not face the same tough regulatory hurdles, analysts noted.

But the potential synergies offered by Iliad, which it put at more than 600 million euros a year, would be higher, and Citi said this month it viewed such a deal as the best outcome.

Iliad, which launched in Italy only six years ago, said the merged business would be expected to make core earnings of about 1.6 billion euros for the year to end-March, implying a multiple for the deal of 7.8 times, higher than the 7.1 times multiple offered last year.

Shares in Telecom Italia rose 3.7%, with traders citing optimism over a tie-up between Iliad and Vodafone, which would reduce the number of players in the market. Swisscom was up 2%.

Telecom Italia (TIM) leads in mobile, including machine-to-machine, with 28% of the market, followed by Vodafone with 27.4%, Hutchison's Wind Tre with 23.8% and Iliad with 9.4%, according to Italian regulator AGCOM's latest data.

TIM has nearly 40% of the fixed-line broadband market, while Vodafone has 16.7% and Fastweb has 14.1%.

Ministers warned to call in Three-Vodafone merger over national security risks,"The Government must call in a planned merger of mobile phone companies Three and Vodafone for closer inspection because of national security risks, the head of the Commons business and trade committee has said.

Labour former minister Liam Byrne suggested the deal could leave communications at the heart of Government, the Cabinet Office, at risk of exploitation by the Chinese state.

Under the terms of the merger, Vodafone would own 51% of the new company, with CK Hutchinson, the Hong Kong-based owner of Three, taking the remaining 49% stake.

The two companies have previously told MPs that the proposals could create thousands of new jobs in the UK, but trade unions warned it could lead to higher prices for consumers.

In the Commons, Mr Byrne suggested the east Asian head office of the CK Group posed a national security risk for the UK.

He said: �We can�t avoid the fact that this proposed deal hands 49% of the merged Three-Vodafone business into the hands of the CK Group. CK Group is based in Hong Kong. As such it falls under the ambit of the Hong Kong national security law.

�As the House knows, once upon a time, Hong Kong was considered meaningfully different from mainland China, but the introduction of the national security law has destroyed Hong Kong�s legal autonomy. It now provides Chinese authorities with the power to demand user data from companies under the threat of fines, asset seizures or indeed imprisonment.�

Mr Byrne added the deal could create a combined company �that runs some of the most sensitive mobile and data contracts in the country�, including NHS 111, police departments, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, and �the monitoring system in the Cabinet Office�.

�The merger radically extends CK Hutchinson�s access to UK telecoms� user data from 9.5 million to over 27 million,� he claimed.

The senior Labour MP continued: �I think the House needs some reassurance this afternoon that this is going to get called in under the terms of the National Security and Investment Act for the hardest possible scrutiny and if there is any hint of a risk, let�s be prudent and let�s block the deal.�

Sir Julian Lewis, the Conservative chairman of Parliament�s intelligence and security committee, warned his cross-party group of MPs and peers would be �locked from scrutinising� the work of the Government�s new investment security unit, which was set up to look into deals like the Three-Vodafone merger.

Sir Julian said: �The Government has consistently said that all its work originally should have been overseen and scrutinised by the then-BEIS select committee and it is now in the Cabinet Office, but even then we are still not being allowed to scrutinise the unit.

�There is something very strange if not sinister going on. We have demanded the right to look at the classified elements of this unit�s work.�

Culture minister Sir John Whittingdale said: �We do have a longstanding and a robust system for looking at the competition aspects of mergers and acquisitions.

�That is something which is conducted independent of Government and for that reason it�s always been the case that Government ministers do not comment on the competition aspects, but rather that is for the regulatory body � which in this case is the Competition and Markets Authority � to make recommendations, and ministers will then reach a decision once that process has been completed.

�In terms of national security implications, we also have an extremely robust system in place but it has always been the case that that is not something the Government talks about as to whether or not ongoing inquiries are taking place.�

He added: �We do take telecoms security, like all other national security matters, extremely seriously.�

Sir John said it is on the record that the Government believes foreign ownership of major critical infrastructure does �raise security concerns� and that is why processes are in place.

In October, the Competition and Markets Authority began inviting interested parties to comment on the deal, in advance of launching a formal investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
�Loyalty penalty� class action claim launched against four largest mobile firms,"Vodafone, EE, Three and O2 are facing a ��3 billion plus� class action claim that alleges the firms used their market dominance to overcharge on up to 28.2 million UK mobile phone contracts.

Justin Gutmann, a former executive with Citizens Advice, and law firm Charles Lyndon claim the UK�s four largest mobile phone network operators charged �loyalty penalties�, leaving existing customers paying more than new customers for the same services.

It specifically claims that long-standing customers were overcharged for handsets beyond the end of their contractual term.

Mr Gutmann alleges the firms overcharged on up to 28.2 million contracts and is seeking damages of at least �3.285 billion.

If successful, a consumer who bought a contract made up of a mobile phone and services such as data, minutes and calls with just one of the mobile operators could receive as much as �1,823, he said.

When these contracts are agreed, their price during the minimum term of the contract includes the cost of both the phone and the use of airtime services.

The claim alleges that the firms failed to reduce the overall amount charged once the minimum contractual term expired, despite the fact that consumers had already paid off their phones.

This resulted in existing customers being charged more than a new customer would be if they were just paying for airtime services.

The class action has been filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London.

All qualifying consumers will be automatically included in the claim for free unless they follow specific steps to opt out.

The claim follows a �super complaint� from Citizens Advice to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in September 2018, which resulted in the CMA finding that: �We do not consider that providers should continue to charge customers the same rate once they have effectively paid off their handsets at the end of the minimum contract period. This is unfair and must be stopped.�

Mr Gutmann said: �I�m launching this class action because I believe these four mobile phone companies have systematically exploited millions of loyal customers across the UK through loyalty penalties, taking over �3 billion out of the pockets of hard working people and their families.

�These companies kept taking advantage of customers despite the financial crisis of 2008, Covid and now the cost-of-living crisis. It�s time they were held to account.�

An O2 spokesman said: �To date there has been no contact with our legal team on this claim. However, we are proud to have been the first provider to have launched split contracts a decade ago which automatically and fully reduce customers� bills once they�ve paid off their handset.

�We�ve long been calling for an end to the �smartphone swindle� and for other mobile operators to stop the pernicious practice of charging their customers for phones they already own.�

An EE spokeswoman said: �We strongly disagree with the speculative claim being brought against us. EE offers a range of tariffs and a robust process for dealing with end of contract notifications.

�The UK mobile market is highly competitive space with some of the lowest pricing across Europe.�

Vodafone said: �This has just been brought to our attention and we don�t yet have sufficient detail for our legal team to assess.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swisscom�s Fastweb Is Said to Weigh Deal for Vodafone Italy,"(Bloomberg) -- Italian telecom operator Fastweb is exploring a potential deal for Vodafone Group Plc�s local operations, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Fastweb, which is owned by Swisscom AG, is among suitors that have been studying a potential combination with Vodafone Italy, the people said, asking not to he identified because the information is private.

Vodafone has also continued to hold on-and-off discussions in recent months with French billionaire Xavier Niel�s Iliad SA about a potential merger of their Italian businesses, the people said, adding that there is no certainty whether Vodafone will decide to proceed with any transaction.

Shares of Vodafone were up 1.5% at 9:20 a.m. Friday in London, giving the company a market value of about �19.5 billion ($24.5 billion). Swisscom shares were little changed in Zurich.

Italy has one of the world�s most competitive telecom markets. The pending sale of Telecom Italia SpA�s network is set to reshape the industry, potentially triggering a wave of further dealmaking among carriers.

Vodafone rejected an �11.25 billion ($12.3 billion) bid for its Italian unit from an Iliad-backed consortium last year, saying the offer wasn�t in shareholders� best interests. Iliad entered the Italian mobile market in 2018, sparking a cutthroat price war with its positioning as a no-frills operator.

Representatives for Fastweb, Iliad, Swisscom and Vodafone declined to comment.

Telstra downplays possibility of allowing customers to roam rival networks during outages,"Telstra has downplayed the possibility of allowing customers of one mobile operator to be able to use another mobile network in the event of a nationwide outage such as the Optus outage earlier this month, arguing it would require massive changes and investment.

In the aftermath of the 14-hour Optus network outage on 8 November, questions were raised as to why Optus customers could not roam on to Telstra�s or Vodafone�s network instead � with a similar system put in place in Canada following an identical outage from one telco last year.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) tasked Telstra with reviewing whether it was feasible in the event of natural disasters and emergencies, and found it was technically feasible, but the regulator said in a submission to the Optus outage Senate inquiry that it did not assess whether it was feasible for a national outage.

Telstra also downplayed the possibility of a national roaming possibility. The temporary roaming being explored is only designed to provide users with access in select areas, covering select towers and not a whole network, Telstra said in its submission to the outage inquiry.

�[The] solution currently being considered in Australia would not be capable of compensating for an outage in the core network of a disrupted MNO [mobile network operator].

�This is because roaming, even temporarily, requires authentication of the end user by their MNO and ultimately the routing of their traffic back to the core network.�

If the capability had been up and running on 8 November, it would not have worked for Optus customers because Optus�s core network was down, Telstra said.

The company said even if the core network was up, the �sudden increase in new connections and traffic from roaming end users would overwhelm the host network�.

To enable full customer fall over during a national mass outage, Telstra said it would have to have subscriber records from every customer of every telco in every system, or it would need to be contained in a government register.

�Both options would require a solution that overcomes the network variations, feature differences or incompatibilities, authentication key synchronisation, security concerns of sharing SIM card encryption keys and proprietary information in subscription records,� Telstra said.

�Implementing such a solution would be highly complex, is likely to be very expensive, and we are not aware of any other country doing this yet.�

Vodafone�s parent company, TPG, said in its submission such a proposal is �likely to be complex and will require government funding support�.

The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) said its preliminary view on complaints received from Optus customers over the outage were mostly seeking compensation � beyond the free 200GB of data offered.

The ombudsman said the harm suffered included being unable to work, make sales, pay for food or bills, attend medical appointments, contact friends or family, study or get information out of Optus about the outage.

The Department of Home Affairs revealed in its submission the outage took down Home Affairs� global service centre on the morning of the outage and also �partially impacted� Border Force operations until business continuity plans were activated.

The department said it first contacted Optus at 7am on the day of the outage via the Signal encrypted communications app to determine whether it was a cyber-attack.

Telstra also defended its role in the 000 emergency call system after it was revealed that 228 Optus mobile customers were unable to connect their 000 calls. Telstra said its service remained operational during the outage and did connect some Optus calls to 000 during the outage.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) is conducting an investigation into the failure of emergency calls to connect and told the committee that remedies, if a breach is found, could include seeking penalties in the federal court.

Kelly Bayer Rosmarin resigned as chief executive of Optus on Monday morning, after giving evidence to the committee on Friday, saying she believed it was in the company�s best interest she leave following the outage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More than 200 Optus customers unable to call triple zero during 14-hour outage, Senate inquiry told","More than 200 of Optus�s customers were unable to call triple zero during the 14-hour outage, the company�s chief executive, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, revealed to a Senate inquiry on Friday.

Bayer Rosmarin and the company�s head of networks, Lambo Kanagaratnam, faced a two-hour grilling before a Senate committee on Friday, chaired by the Greens communications spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young. Questions explored the outage itself as well as the company�s communication to customers and what will be done to prevent it happening again.

Decades-long rules mean mobile phones should be able to dial triple zero even when their mobile provider�s network is down by connecting via another network.

But Bayer Rosmarin said on Friday that 228 of the Optus customers who attempted to call triple zero during the outage on Wednesday last week were unable to connect their call.

The company had since conducted a welfare check on those customers and �thankfully everybody is OK�, she said.

The issue sparked an Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) investigation which Bayer Rosmarin should happen expeditiously.

�We absolutely believe that the triple zero system should have worked and it�s critical for all Australians that that system can be relied upon,� she said. �We don�t manage the triple zero system. It�s a very complex system that involves all the carriers.�

Bayer Rosmarin told the hearing she now carries both a Telstra and a Vodafone sim card with her in case of another outage like the one that took down Optus last week.

Bayer Rosmarin said she previously carried a spare Vodafone sim in case of an outage, but now also carries a spare Telstra sim.

�I now have all three. I used to have Vodafone and I have Telstra now too,� she said.

Bayer Rosmarin also said she did not speak to the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, until four hours into the outage last week.

�When I got up in the morning, I could see that the phone wasn�t working. And so I immediately decided to head into the office.�

She said she arrived at the office at 7.35am and had a crisis meeting from 7.45am until 8.30am. She said she spoke to the minister after that.

Bayer Rosmarin said her team had been in contact with the minister�s office before then, and that she assured Rowland Optus was working to restore the network as quickly as possible.

Optus initially claimed on Monday the outage was caused by changes to routing information supplied from an international peering network after a routine software upgrade. The company did not reveal until late on Wednesday that the peering network in question was Optus�s parent company�s Singtel Internet Exchange (STiX).

Sign up for Guardian Australia�s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup

However, Singtel moved to distance itself from responsibility, saying Optus had been informed in advance about the upgrade and that it had not caused the outage. Kanagaratnam said on Friday it was ultimately an issue with Optus�s Cisco routers not being configured correctly.

�The outage was as a result of our defences for the change in our routing information not working as it should have been and that�s something obviously we�ve addressed,� he told the Senate committee. �And we�ve worked around the clock to ensure that we address all the issues that we found.�

During the outage about 90 of the company�s routers went offline due to a failsafe mechanism after receiving an overload in routing information, triggering the network shutdown. About 150 engineers were required to visit 14 sites across the country to reactivate them.

Bayer Rosmarin said the company had to perform a �hard reboot of the network� at about 10.30am on the Wednesday � a �brute force resuscitation of the network�. While the crisis was over for customers at 4pm, it took the team several days to determine what caused it.

The company had initially wondered whether it was a result of another cyber-attack, with Bayer Rosmarin noting there were �strange coincidences� between last week�s incident and last year�s cyber-attack, most notably that the Singtel board was in Australia for both. That idea was quickly ruled out, she said.

The company had conducted an outage exercise in October but did not account for the entire network going down. Kanagaratnam said Optus had now put in place protections so a similar event could not occur in future.

So far, 8,500 customers and small businesses have contacted Optus about compensation for losses amounting to $430,000 in compensation. The company had already applied $36,000 in compensation.

Related: Telcos could be forced to let customers roam rival networks during outages under plan Optus opposed

Bayer Rosmarin said Optus was keen to have a �broad� discussion about consequential losses as a result of the outage, noting that it would have wider implications for the NBN and other sectors going forward.

�We felt that this was an issue that�s much more broad and that should government choose to look into this we�d love to be part of that conversation. But there is no precedent for telcos or other essential providers covering consequential loss,� she said.

�We are very conscious that this would have far-reaching implications, not just for Optus, not just for all telcos, including the NBN, also for other essential services, utilities, government services, and that this needs to be a much broader conversation.�

She also said that measures allowing Optus customers to roam on to rival networks were not in place, and would take some discussion with other industry players and investment in capacity before it could happen in future.

The CEO also faced criticism from senators over the company�s communications with customers during the outage. She acknowledged that the company had only provided select media interviews, and said she would consider holding press conferences in the future, but it was �unusual for a CEO� to front the public during an outage.

Bayer Rosmarin did not directly respond to reports suggesting she could resign as early as next week, instead saying her focus had been on responding to the outage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone loses thousands of customers after pushing through inflation-busting price rises,"Vodafone has shed thousands of customers after rolling out inflation-busting price rises earlier this year.

The telecoms company lost 49,000 contract customers in the UK in the first half of the year, which it blamed on price increases of nearly 15pc that took effect from April.

Vodafone also raised broadband and mobile prices in Germany, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of customer losses there.

The company is facing a class action lawsuit over its decision to increase prices by �5-a-month for broadband and fixed-line phone customers in Germany, a country that makes up almost a third of its total revenue. Consumer group VZBV claims the increase was imposed �unilaterally and without legal basis�.

Despite shedding customers, the higher prices helped boost Vodafone�s revenues.

UK income rose by 4.1pc and Vodafone helped offset contract losses with new customers signing up to its digital brand Voxi, which offers unlimited social media use.

Higher prices boosted average revenue per user and Germany returned to growth in the second quarter.

Overall, Vodafone posted a 4.2pc increase in service revenue in the first half to �19.2bn (�16.7bn).

The improved results come as chief executive Margherita Della Valle tries to steer a turnaround after years of decline. Ms Della Valle acknowledged the company �must change� when she took over as chief executive at the beginning of the year.

The Vodafone boss has unveiled plans to cut 11,000 jobs and announced a �15bn mega-merger with Three in the UK.

The company has also inked a deal to sell its Spanish operations for �5bn and is considering options in other markets, such as Italy. Earlier this week it announced plans to spin-out its internal procurement and services division into a joint venture with Accenture.

Total group revenue fell 4.3pc to �21.9bn across the first six months of Vodafone�s financial year, reflecting the fact that businesses have been sold and no longer show up in the results.

Revenue from Vodafone�s mast joint venture, as well as its operations in Hungary and Ghana, was missing when compared to last year after the company exited those businesses.

Operating profit also dropped by more than 44pc to �1.7bn as a result of the disposals and foreign exchange movements.

Dan Ridsdale, director of TMT at Edison Group, said there were �possibly some green shoots of a recovery� in Vodafone�s figures.

But he added: �With the announcement earlier this year that the company and Three will merge their UK-based operations, creating the biggest mobile network in the UK, along with the exit from the Spanish market and the strategic partnership with Accenture relatively fresh, the shares may remain in a holding pattern until the outcome of these strategic actions becomes clearer.�

Shares in Vodafone were down more than 2pc in early trading.

Vodafone cut its net debt by 20pc to �36.2bn and the company announced an interim dividend of 4.5 cents per share.

The company reiterated its full-year guidance for adjusting earnings to remain flat at around �13.3bn and free cash flow of roughly �3.3bn.

Ms Della Valle said: �During the first half of the year, we have delivered improved revenue growth in nearly all of our markets and have returned to growth in Germany in the second quarter.

�Vodafone�s transformation is progressing. Our focus on customers and simplifying our business is beginning to bear fruit, although much more needs to be done.

�We have also announced transactions to strengthen our position in the UK and exit the challenging Spanish market in order to right-size our portfolio for growth.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vodafone 'looking at options' for Italy, its final problem market","LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) -British telecoms group Vodafone said it was considering a range of options for Italy, the last of the ""challenging"" markets it has vowed to tackle, after a return to growth in Germany in the second quarter boosted its top line.

CEO Margherita Della Valle said her steps to simplify the company and focus on customers had delivered growth in 14 out of 17 markets. Spain and Italy remained the exceptions in Vodafone's major markets.

Vodafone announced the sale of its Spanish business last month for 5 billion euros, after agreeing in June to merge its UK unit with Hutchison's Three.

Della Valle said she had flagged three markets that would benefit from consolidation in May, and action had been taken in two of them.

""No operator in Italy delivers returns in excess of cost of capital, no one,"" she told reporters.

It was a ""very different"" situation from Spain, she said, pointing to the strength of its brand and network. The market itself needed action, she said.

""We are considering a range of options,"" she said. ""We don't have deadlines, we don't have time lines.""

Vodafone executives are examining possible options including a sale or joint venture for its Italian operations, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Operators in Italy are studying ways to consolidate a market grappling with shrinking revenue and margins, which is depriving investors from any return on capital.

Potential candidates for a deal with Vodafone include French rival Iliad, which last year tabled a 11 billion euro bid for the asset, according to other sources.

Iliad said on Tuesday it had gained 382,000 new subscribers in Italy in its third quarter, its best performance for three years.

A spokesperson for Iliad declined to comment, although its CEO Thomas Reynaud told reporters on Tuesday: ""If there is consolidation in Italy, we want to participate actively.""

Newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore said at the weekend that Swisscom's Fastweb could be another potential buyer for the business.

Della Valle declined to comment on speculation about either company. A Swisscom spokesperson also declined to comment.

Vodafone reported a 4.2% rise in group service revenue for the six months to the end of September, with 4.7% growth in the second quarter after 3.7% in the first. A 0.3% rise in adjusted half-year core earnings was limited by higher energy costs.

It reiterated its guidance for full-year earnings to be broadly flat at around 13.3 billion euros ($14.2 billion).

Shares in the group, which have fallen 26% in the last 12 months, reversed early gains to trade down 2.5% by lunchtime.

"European stocks subdued ahead of key eurozone GDP, U.S. CPI data","Investing.com - European stock markets traded in subdued manner Tuesday, as investors awaited the release of key European growth and U.S. inflation data.

At 03:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France traded up 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. dropped 0.1%.

U.S. CPI release looms large
Investors are on data watch Tuesday, limiting the trading volatility so far.

Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have kept the option of further rate hikes on the table after the central bank held interest rates unchanged at its last meeting, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying last week they were still not sure rates are high enough to tame inflation.

This puts the focus squarely on the release of the latest U.S. consumer price index, due later in the session, with investors looking for data that would support the case for the Federal Reserve to be finished with interest rate increases.

Analysts expect the yearly gain for the top line number to rise 3.3% from the prior year, while it is expected to rise 0.1% for the month. Core CPI is expected to rise 4.1% for the year and 0.3% for the month.

Eurozone GDP data also on slate
Back in Europe, the European Central Bank also snapped a streak of ten straight rate hikes last month, but a number of policymakers have since indicated that further rate hikes should not be taken off the table even as consumer prices have fallen.

There is growth data, in the form of the eurozone third-quarter gross domestic product release, to digest later in the session, which are expected to show that the bloc�s economy is struggling under the weight of those interest rate increases.

Germany�s ZEW survey of economic sentiment in November is also due later, while the U.K. unemployment rate remained at 4.2% in September, with wages growing slightly less quickly in the three months to September but remaining close to their record pace.

Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) soars after move in Canadian steel market

Delivery Hero (ETR:DHER) stock rose 2.9% after the German online takeaway food company slightly raised its full-year outlook.

Crude boosted by positive OPEC report
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by the latest monthly OPEC report stating that demand remains strong, although concerns over slowing demand remain.

By 03:40 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $78.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $82.79 a barrel.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries slightly raised its 2023 forecast for growth in global oil demand, in its monthly report, released Monday, and stuck to its bullish 2024 prediction.

The cartel blamed speculators for the recent drop in prices, after the benchmarks fell to their lowest level since July last week, hurt by concerns that demand could slip in top oil consumers U.S. and China.

EU antitrust regulators see no issues with Vodafone Hutchison mobile tie-up,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Vodafone and CK Hutchison's $19 billion mobile merger in Britain does not pose any competition concerns to EU antitrust regulators, according to a European Commission filing.

The companies sought approval from the EU competition enforcer for their bid to create the UK's biggest mobile operator on Oct. 30.

The Commission, which set a Dec. 6 deadline for its decision, is reviewing the deal under its simplified procedure.

It uses this procedures for mergers which are not likely to raise competition concerns and where clearance is a foregone conclusion.

The deal in contrast faces intense scrutiny from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority because it will reduce the number of networks from four to three, a threshold which regulators worry could reduce competition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explainer-Why are European telecom firms selling assets?,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Vodafone's bid on Tuesday to sell its Spanish business is the latest move by European telecom firms trying to strengthen their financial health by divesting assets, consolidating markets and selling stakes to investors.

Buried under billions of euros of debt, European telecom companies operate in small, highly competitive markets, unlike their peers in other regions, making it difficult for them to find growth.

What options do the telecom firms have to expand?

CONSOLIDATION

European telcos have been trying to break a deadlock on mergers for years in the face of opposition from regulators.

In Europe, many countries have four telecom operators jostling for share in small markets, which usually equates to lower prices for consumers but less profit for the companies, analysts say.

Mergers would reduce the number of operators, and regulators are concerned that could lead to higher prices, less choice and a reduction in quality for consumers, particularly if two local players join forces in one market.

Spanish telecom companies Orange and MasMovil announced a $19 billion merger last year, set to be a test case for whether Europe's antitrust regulators have become more lenient in approving deals that reduce the number of mobile operators.

The EU competition enforcer in June reiterated its worries about such a merger, indicating the telecoms operators may need to offer significant remedies to get the deal approved.

""Orange/MasMovil is a crucial alliance for the European telecoms sector as it could open the door to other tie-ups if approved,"" CCS Insight analyst Kester Mann said.

""The Commission probably wanted some clarity on Vodafone's long-term position in Spain before deciding, so today�s news could help that process along.""

Vodafone, which earlier tried buying MasMovil, announced in June a $19 billion merger of British mobile operations with CK Hutchison, and is braced for prolonged scrutiny by the regulators.

DIVESTING ASSETS

In the last few years, telecom firms have been selling non-core assets such as mobile tower businesses to raise cash. American Tower and Cellnex spent billions of dollars in buying up the mobile masts.

Spain's Telefonica, for one, received 7.7 billion euros for selling its towers business.

Now companies are looking to offload businesses closer to their main operations.

Telecom Italia is in talks to sell its network grid to U.S. fund KKR for about $24 billion as it looks to reduce its debt and stem cash burning.

Private investors such as French tycoon Xavier Niel took telecoms firm Iliad private for $3.7 billion in 2021, following billionaire Patrick Drahi, whose personal holding company took private the listed owner of France's second-biggest telecoms group, SFR.

FOREIGN FIRMS BUY STAKES

The weakness of European telecom firms has given Middle Eastern telecom companies an opportunity to build presence in the region.

Between Saudi telecoms group STC and UAE�s e&, they have spent over 5 billion euros in four deals in Europe in the last year.

STC had been looking to increase its holding in Telefonica to 9.9%, worth 2.1 billion euros, and become the Spanish telecom group's top shareholder.

UAE's e& also increased its stake in Vodafone to 14% in February, and was seeking to increase the stake to 20%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone chief sells Spanish business for �4.4bn in race to slim down,"Vodafone has sold its Spanish business for �5bn (�4.4bn) as new boss Margherita Della Valle races to slim down the struggling telecoms giant.

The company has signed a deal to sell its operations in Spain to Zegona Communications, an investment vehicle set up by two former Virgin Media executives.

Ms Della Valle said the sale was a �key step in right-sizing our portfolio for growth and will enable us to focus our resources in markets with sustainable structures and sufficient local scale�.

The Vodafone chief, who took up the role at the start of the year, had announced a strategic review of the company�s operations in Spain as part of a wider plan to return the group to growth after years of decline.

In May, the chief executive revealed plans to cut 11,000 jobs, while the company is also gearing up for a �15bn merger with Three in a deal that will create the UK�s largest mobile network.

Ms Della Valle said: �My priority is to create value through growth and improved returns. Following the recently announced transaction in the UK, Spain is the second of our larger markets in Europe where we are taking action to improve the group�s competitiveness and growth prospects.�

Vodafone is the third largest player in the Spanish telecoms market after Telefonica and Orange, which is currently in the process of merging with the fourth biggest company MasMovil.

Spain has proved a major drag on Vodafone�s financial performance as the company struggled with tough competition and low returns.

Kester Mann, an analyst at CCS Insight, said the deal came as �little surprise�.

Other markets including Italy could also be in line for consolidation. Shares in Vodafone fell as much as 1.8pc following the announcement.

Zegona will enter into a 10-year contract to licence the brand and Vodafone will also continue to provide some services to the Spanish business for an annual service charge of �110m.

London-based Zegona was set up in 2015 by Eamonn O�Hare and Robert Samuelson, who both held senior roles at Virgin Media.

Mr O�Hare, chairman and chief executive of Zegona, said: �We are very excited about the opportunity to return to the Spanish telecoms market.

�This financially attractive acquisition marks our third deal in Spain after successful turnarounds at Telecable and Euskaltel.

�With our clearly defined strategy and proven track record, we are confident that we can create significant value for shareholders.�

The deal will be funded by �4.1bn in cash, while Vodafone will provide up to �900m in financing in the form of redeemable preference shares.

Zegona will also raise up to �600m in equity from investors ahead of the deal, which will constitute a reverse takeover under London Stock Exchange rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vodafone exits Spain with $5.3 billion sale to Zegona,"LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone will sell its Spanish business to Zegona Communications for 5 billion euros ($5.30 billion), marking the second major deal by its new CEO and an exit from a market that has dragged on performance for years.

Vodafone Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle, who has vowed to reshape the UK telecoms group to drive growth, said the sale would enable it to focus on markets with ""sustainable structures and sufficient local scale"".

London-listed Zegona, chaired and managed by telecoms executive Eamonn O'Hare, has previously bought and sold regional operators Telecable and Euskaltel in Spain.

Vodafone Spain had strong brands and networks, he said, but its low cashflow margin and falling revenue needed to be fixed.

""We have a better plan,"" O'Hare told Reuters, including bringing in former Euskaltel CEO Jos� Miguel Garc�a to run the business.

""The revenues are going backwards one or two percent, we need to get them going forwards one or two percent,"" he said.

Zegona is funding the deal with 4.2 billion euros in debt led by Deutsche Bank, and 900 million euros from Vodafone in preference shares.

O'Hare said he would raise equity of up to 600 million euros from Zegona's shareholders, helping bring debt down to a number beginning with a three and leverage to a number in the twos.

Shares in Vodafone, which will receive at least 4.1 billion euros in cash, reversed early gains to trade down 1% on Tuesday afternoon. The stock remains close to 20-year lows.

Since being named permanent CEO in April, Della Valle announced 11,000 job cuts and the merger of Vodafone's British unit with CK Hutchison's Three.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said Della Valle was delivering on her vow to review Vodafone's structure, but investors were unmoved.

He said the deal improved earnings but it was cashflow dilutive, and it was cash that funded Vodafone's dividend, where cover was already ""fairly skinny"".

Enders Analysis' Karen Egan said the multiple of 5.3 times core earnings was well below other recent deals, and was disappointing in the context of Vodafone's history in Spain, where it had paid 7.2 billion euros to buy Ono in 2014.

But she said Della Valle was under pressure to deliver a deal, and Zegona's track record in Spain made it somewhat uniquely qualified to take on the challenge.

SPANISH MARKET

Vodafone ranks third in Spanish telecoms after Telefonica and Orange. The latter is combining with the fourth largest player MasMovil.

Zegona's O'Hare said he was ""very excited"" to return to the market after successful turnarounds at Telecable and Euskaltel.

Vodafone's brands would remain, he said, including value-offer Lowi. It will pay Vodafone about 110 million euros a year for services such as sourcing smartphones.

One change could be wholesaling Vodafone's fixed and mobile networks. ""We will be reaching out and talking with Orange and MasMovil and with Telefonica and finding ways to make sure that the assets that we have are going to be utilised to the max,"" he said.

"Vodafone Nears Stake Sale in �5 Billion Spanish Unit to Zegona, Sources Say","(Bloomberg) -- Vodafone Group Plc is close to selling a stake of at least 50% in its Spanish business to Zegona Communications Plc in a deal that values the asset at more than �5 billion ($5.3 billion), according to people familiar with the matter.

The firms are finalizing details of a transaction and an announcement could come in the coming days, the people said. London-based Zegona, an acquisition vehicle, has beaten out other bidders including private equity firm RRJ Capital in the process, the people said.

While discussions are at an advanced stage, they could still be delayed or even falter, according to the people. Vodafone didn�t immediately respond to a request for comment made outside of normal business hours. A spokesman for Zegona reiterated the details of a statement on Sept. 22, when the company confirmed talks with Vodafone and said it was discussing financing with its banks.

Newbury, England-based Vodafone has been trying to do a deal in Spain for more than a year. Its previous chief executive officer Nick Read said the market needed consolidation, but ended up on the sidelines as its rivals agreed to merge. Following years of eroding earnings, Read�s replacement, Margherita Della Valle, demoted the unit to Vodafone�s so-called �cluster� of smaller European businesses and placed it under strategic review.

The British carrier has been working with an adviser as it evaluates options for the Spanish business, Bloomberg News reported in July. Warburg Pincus was among those considering a bid for the assets, while Apollo Global Management Inc. has also shown initial interest, people familiar with the matter said previously.

In September, Vodafone said it was in talks with Zegona about a potential deal for the Spanish unit. A consortium led by RRJ Capital, the buyout firm run by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Richard Ong, was weighing an offer for the assets as well, Bloomberg News reported last week.

Spain�s telecoms market, already one of Europe�s most competitive, is expected to undergo a deep transformation in the coming months. Orange SA and Masmovil Ibercom SA are awaiting regulatory clearance to merge in a deal that will create Spain�s largest carrier, ahead of Telefonica SA.

The European Commission is tipped to impose strict conditions for the merger, which could potentially lead to Orange and Masmovil having to sell certain assets to a smaller rival. The decision will be taken as a sign of the Commission�s willingness to allow consolidation in the sector.

Zegona, which describes itself as having a �buy-fix-sell� strategy, has already played a key role in the sector�s consolidation in Spain. Founded in 2015 and run by former Virgin Media Ltd. executive Eamonn O�Hare, the company bought and sold Spanish operator Euskaltel SA to Masmovil Ibercom, a deal the took the market from five players down to four.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mobile phone rural �not spots� fix faces major delay,"A Government promise to improve mobile coverage in rural areas has been dealt a major setback after network operators warned they will not meet a key deadline.

Vodafone, Three and Virgin Media O2 have asked the Government for a delay of up to two years to complete the first stage of the Shared Rural Network (SRN).

The SRN was one of former prime minister�s Boris Johnson�s key pledges during the 2019 election campaign, with Mr Johnson promising to reach an agreement on tackling the so-called �not spots� that plague rural communities within 100 days of taking office.

Under the first phase of the �1bn plan, mobile networks have until June 2024 to expand their 4G coverage to reach 88pc of the UK�s landmass.

However, the companies have written to the Government asking for the deadline to be extended as they struggle to build new masts in time.

The delay will fuel fears that the Government will fail to meet its target of delivering 4G coverage to the entire country by early 2027, though mobile firms have insisted the final deadline is not at risk.

A failure to meet the initial deadline in an election year will also leave the Conservative Party open to the charge of letting down countryside voters.

Mark Tufnell, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: �Viewed as a necessity in urban areas, the Government sees mobile connectivity in the countryside as a luxury, and it�s preventing many rural businesses from even operating in the 21st century.

�This delay will lead to missed opportunities, increased costs, supply chain disruptions, and stunted innovation across the rural economy � undermining the livelihoods of those living within it.

�Unless the Government urgently acts to minimise delays, rural communities will continue to suffer and their potential remain unrealised.�

Sources accused Vodafone and Three in particular of being �miles behind� in the SRN project. However, Virgin Media O2 may also miss the deadline by several months.

BT-owned EE, which has more mobile masts than its rivals, is contributing to phase one separately, largely by upgrading existing sites.

Any delays to the SRN risk leaving millions of households and businesses with patchy mobile connections and will undermine the Government�s levelling-up ambitions.

Industry insiders said the extension request was unlikely to be well-received in Whitehall, particularly after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak scrapped the northern leg of the HS2 rail project.

Failure to complete another public infrastructure project in time would be a further blow to the Government in the run-up to next year�s general election.

Mobile bosses have blamed the delays on the pandemic, as well as difficulties in securing planning permission to build new masts. Sources said it had taken as long as 500 days to receive planning approvals for some sites.

However, one executive also questioned whether Vodafone and Three have neglected the project as they prepare for a �15bn merger that will create the UK�s largest mobile network.


The two companies have argued that they individually lack the financial firepower to upgrade their 5G networks and have pledged to invest �11bn as a combined company.

Delays to the SRN have sparked scrutiny over the operators� ability to meet investment pledges.

During a Business and Trade Committee hearing with Vodafone and Three bosses last week, Tory MP Mark Pawsey said: �You�re making promises to us about the investment that will take place if this merger goes ahead. How do we know that you�re going to deliver that if you haven�t yet completed the commitment that you made on the Shared Rural Network?�

Vodafone and Three denied they had neglected the SRN and insisted the merger had no impact on their day-to-day operations.

Phase one of the project is focused on �partial not spot� areas where at least one operator provides coverage but not all of them. Phase two, which will be funded by the Government, targets �total not spot� areas, where no operators currently provide 4G services.

The deadline for phase two is early 2027, though it is expected coverage will be delivered to 95pc of the UK by the end of 2025.

The National Audit Office, which monitors public spending, is currently carrying out a review of the SRN and is expected to publish its findings early next year.

A Three spokesman said: �We are on track to deliver the overall January 2027 target for 4G geographic coverage under the SRN programme having already built 100 sites and secured planning on 80pc of the new sites that we have committed to.

�However, we have recently written to the government asking for an extension to the June 2024 interim target which was agreed immediately prior to the Covid lockdowns and has been impacted by delays associated with the pandemic.�

A Vodafone spokesman said: �We remain committed to delivering on all elements of the SRN programme and have successfully introduced 4G to rural locations across the UK as part of the wider project which is due for delivery by January 2027.�

A spokesman for Virgin Media O2 said: �We�re continuing to invest and deliver these upgrades at pace and we expect to either meet or come very close to meeting our own individual target. We are in regular discussions with government and industry, and remain committed to delivering the full benefits of the SRN as soon as possible.�

A government spokesman said: �All four Mobile Network Operators have been set clear coverage targets as part of their licence obligations, which they are on track to meet and are managed by Ofcom.

�We are in regular communication with them regarding their progress, which the regulator will assess in 2024.�",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK mobile operator EE eyes growth from new retail platform,"LONDON (Reuters) - EE, Britain's biggest mobile operator, said on Wednesday it would launch a sales platform called EE ID to try to grow its retail offering by selling gaming consoles and other electronics to people who are not existing customers.

EE, owned by UK telecoms giant BT, said its new platform would be open to anyone in Britain and sell gaming consoles, tablets and upgrade packages, in the same way it currently sells smartphones.

""It's about giving customers more reasons to be with EE more often, to create more stickiness with the brand,"" EE Chief Executive Marc Allera said a press conference.

EE says it is currently Britain's largest retailer of smartphones.

In Britain's mature mobile market, where EE competes with VM O2, jointly owned by Telefonica and Liberty Global, plus Vodafone and CK Hutchison's Three, mobile network providers are hunting for new ways to grow their businesses.

Vodafone and Three are in the process of trying to merge so they can invest to build new 5G infrastructure and attract new customers.

EE also said on Wednesday that it planned to offer an enhanced TV package by providing subscribers with Apple TV, as it seeks to build its customer base by bundling broadband, mobile and TV services.

"Vodafone and Three merger could create jobs, firms claim","A merger of mobile networks Vodafone and Three could create thousands of new jobs in the sector, the two companies have told MPs, amid ongoing scrutiny of the proposed deal.

Trade union has Unite criticised the deal, warning it could lead to higher prices for consumers and job cuts.

But appearing before the House of Commons Business and Trade Committee scrutinising the proposed deal, representatives from the two mobile operators that argued that the work needed to build and maintain the infrastructure required to run the new network would create more jobs in the sector.

When asked by MPs about the possibility of jobs losses as a result of the merger, Nicki Lyons, Vodafone UK corporate affairs and sustainability director, said: �We�re not in a position to give numbers at this stage, we haven�t worked through that level of detail.

�What we do know is that while there is some duplication with head office jobs, the actual number of employees that we will need to create the new infrastructure that we�re investing in will be significant.

�We believe that jobs will actually be created as a consequence of this merger for building the network, to create and support the IT systems and to maintain this new network.�

She added that the companies believed that the better 5G availability created by the merger would also produce a �knock-on benefit to the country as a whole�, as better 5G connectivity could help stimulate small businesses.

Andrea Dona, Vodafone UK�s network and development director said that the company�s own estimates suggest the deal �could create up to 12,000 jobs�.

But George Stevenson, bargaining and investigative researcher at Unite, dismissed that suggestion and warned that the trade union�s research into similar deals in the UK and elsewhere had often seen job cuts as a result and said the proposed merger was a �very worrying sign for workers in these sectors�.

�We can only speak to what is proposed to happen here � the merger of Three and Vodafone � and based on our research of comparable mergers in the UK and the US, we would expect there to be job cuts in the region of 1,000 to 1,600 for Three and Vodafone staff,� he told the committee.

�We also know Vodafone is not shy about cutting jobs � it is currently in the process of axing 11,000 globally, including in the UK.�

In contrast, Three general counsel and regulatory affairs director, Stephen Lerner, said job losses at the network would be more likely if the merger did not happen, noting that the �industry trend is job losses�.

Last week, the UK�s competition watchdog asked third parties to submit their views of the merger ahead of it launching a formal investigation in the deal.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it will be �carefully considering how this deal may affect competition in the UK, which could affect the options and prices available to customers�.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vodafone, Three execs tell lawmakers their UK merger will benefit 5G, jobs","LONDON (Reuters) - Executives from Vodafone and CK Hutchison's Three UK unit said their 15 billion pound ($18 billion) merger would benefit Britain's consumers, infrastructure and jobs, as lawmakers scrutinise the planned tie-up.

Vodafone and Three UK have pledged to invest 11 billion pounds to build a 5G network for Britain as part of their bid to secure backing from politicians, unions and competition authorities for the merger announced in June.

Britain's antitrust watchdog last week kicked off its examination of the deal, while lawmakers from the business and trade committee on Tuesday asked what the deal would mean for jobs.

""We believe that actually jobs will be created as a consequence of this merger both for building the network, and to create and support the IT systems, and to maintain this new network,"" Vodafone UK's corporate affairs and sustainability director Nicki Lyons said.

She said the companies were not giving numbers at this stage, and conceded that head office duplication could be an issue.

Trade union Unite has warned the deal will result in higher bills and job losses.

Representatives from both the companies said that as the current No. 3 and No. 4 players in Britain's mobile market they did not have the scale to invest and compete against the two biggest operators, BT's EE and VM O2, jointly owned by Telefonica and Liberty Global.

They warned that without the deal, Britain's 5G network would continue to lag that of other European nations.

""Neither us nor Vodafone can invest sufficiently to build the type of 5G network that's needed,"" Three's Chief Technical Officer David Hennessy said.

The two companies have long known that a proposed merger would face intense scrutiny from regulators who have previously opposed deals that reduce the number of networks in major markets from four to three.

But the tie-up would not result in price rises for consumers, said Three's general counsel Stephen Lerner.

""We are not planning any increases in price,"" he said, explaining the merged entity would be keen to price competitively to ensure it filled the new capacity it wants to build.

"Vodafone-Three merger could add up to �300 a year to mobile bills, says union","Mobile phone bills could rise by as much as �300 a year as a result of the merger of the UK operations of Vodafone and the owner of Three, a trade union has said.

Unite has been a vocal critic of the proposed deal, which would create the UK�s largest mobile operator, and said that it is a �terrible� deal that also poses risks for national security.

�This evidence if clear: this merger is a terrible deal for Britain,� said George Stevenson, an investigative researcher at Unite, who is due to give evidence at a hearing exploring the deal being held by the business and trade select committee of MPs on Tuesday.

�When you reduce competition, prices go up, jobs get slashed, and the promise of investment turns out to be hollow,� he said. �We will continue to fighting to ensure this harmful merger is scrutinised thoroughly by regulators and government alike.�

In 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the European Commission blocked Three�s attempted takeover of O2, arguing that it would have risked higher prices. The two companies had attempted to allay concerns and sweeten their position with regulators by offering to freeze prices for UK consumers for five years.

The strategy is one that could be emulated by Vodafone and Three UK, which have promised �11bn of investment in 5G infrastructure over the next decade if the deal is cleared.

Last week, the UK competition watchdog offered rivals and other interested parties the chance to submit views on the proposed merger. The CMA has said it was providing an �early opportunity� for interested third parties to comment on the impact of a merger of the two companies on the UK telecoms market.

The companies are the UK�s third and fourth biggest mobile operators. The combined company will, if the merger is completed, have more than 27 million subscribers, leapfrogging EE, owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2, owned by Spain�s Telef�nica and the US-listed company Liberty Global.

The deal is likely to face close scrutiny from the CMA, although last year the UK telecoms regulator, Ofcom, changed its long-held stance, saying it was now more open to consolidation in the sector. It had previously argued that dropping to only three networks in a country could harm consumers.

The government is likely to �call in� the deal for scrutiny under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, which allows ministers to block transactions linked to important national assets if they are deemed to harm national security.

Vodafone UK has a number of government contracts and Three UK is owned by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, which may raise concerns about foreign joint ownership of a key national asset, particularly given the city�s status as part of China.

UK regulator examining Vodafone-Hutchison's $19 billion mobile merger,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's antitrust watchdog is examining whether a $19 billion tie-up between Vodafone's UK operation and CK Hutchison's Three UK would substantially lessen competition, it said on Wednesday.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) invited comments from interested parties on the deal announced in June which would create the UK's biggest mobile operator.

The CMA is gathering information before it starts a formal Phase 1 investigation in the next few months that must then be completed within 40 working days. If it finds the deal could lead to less competition, it will launch a deeper investigation that lasts 24 weeks.

The deal will reduce the number of networks to three from four, challenging a tenet long held by regulators that having four in major markets helps keep prices low.

A proposed tie-up between Three UK and Telefonica's O2 in Britain was blocked by the European Commission in 2016 on the grounds that a reduction to three networks would reduce competition and likely result in higher prices.

Vodafone and Three UK have pledged to invest 11 billion pounds ($13.5 billion) to create ""one of Europe's most advanced standalone 5G networks"" in a bid to win over politicians, unions and competition authorities.

CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell said: ""We will be carefully considering how this deal may affect competition in the UK, which could affect the options and prices available to customers.

""We will also assess how it may affect incentives to invest in the quality of UK mobile networks.""

Vodafone said it was ""actively engaging with the CMA"" and welcomed their move to invite views from third parties.

""We want to build one of Europe's leading 5G networks and believe the combination of Vodafone UK and Three UK will be great for customers, the country and competition,"" a spokesperson said.

Three UK declined to comment.

Can Vodafone (VOD) Benefit From Open RAN Network Thrust?,"Vodafone Group Plc VOD has reaffirmed its commitment toward Open Radio Access Network (RAN) technology by pledging to work in unison with Intel Corporation INTC for the development of purpose-built architecture for commercial deployment across the globe. At the same time, Vodafone is partnering with Nokia Corporation NOK and Orange SA ORAN for a pilot run in Italy and Romania, respectively. The trial is part of the network modernization initiative of Vodafone, as it aims to scale up operations to effectively handle exponential growth in data traffic.

The Open RAN network enables service providers to utilize non-proprietary subcomponents from a variety of vendors. It helps to increase vendor diversity and avoid lock-in by facilitating programmable, intelligent, disaggregated, virtualized and interoperable functions. The increasing propensity to shift from single-vendor solutions towards open, multi-vendor networks is mostly driven by service providers� need for enhanced control, interoperability and flexibility.

Vodafone had earlier agreed to collaborate with Intel in 2022 to develop its own chip architecture. The two firms will now join forces to design chipsets at Vodafone�s campus in Malaga, Spain. The company aims to leverage Intel�s strength in silicon architecture with its networking expertise, rapid prototyping, verification and testing and eventual mass production of innovative chips. These chipsets will then be made available to smaller third-party vendors to test their own algorithms.

Partnering with Orange, Vodafone has successfully made 4G calls in a rural area near Bucharest, Romania, based on Open RAN technology. The companies are working together to select strategic vendors to roll out Open RAN technology for future mobile networks across Europe. This will offer Orange greater flexibility to add new radio sites or upgrade existing ones while keeping the cost and energy consumption low. This model will likely serve as a blueprint to extend 4G and 5G networks to rural communities across Europe.

The 5G transition is expected to be disruptive, creating new avenues for industries across the board. 5G is likely to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry, which is expected to propel the wide proliferation of IoT. The telecom firms are facilitating their customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation.

Further, Vodafone has partnered with Nokia to run a commercial 5G Open RAN pilot study in Italy. This will likely offer a platform for more independent software providers, start-ups and local firms to collaborate for innovation. By unlocking network efficiencies with common operability, software delivery and increased hardware sharing, Nokia has reduced the total cost of ownership for mobile operators. The company is well-positioned for the ongoing technology cycle, given the strength of its end-to-end portfolio.

Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, Nokia is transforming the way people and things communicate and connect with each other. These include a seamless transition to 5G technology, ultra-broadband access, IP and Software Defined Networking, cloud applications and the Internet of Things.

The concerted efforts are part of Vodafone�s strategy to widely deploy Open RAN across Europe, as it aims to deploy 2,500 Open RAN sites in the United Kingdom. These will likely lead to the wider adoption of disaggregated and automated solutions with the proliferation of Open RAN technology.

The stock has lost 15.2% over the past year against the industry�s growth of 4.5%.

Vodafone to create Open RAN chip sets with Intel,"LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone underlined its commitment to Open RAN networks on Monday by confirming it would create purpose-built chipset architecture for the nascent technology with Intel.

The European operator also said it had made its first 4G calls using Open RAN over network sites shared with Orange in Romania, and it was partnering with Nokia to pilot the technology in Italy.

Open RAN allows mobile operators to mix and match equipment from various suppliers, potentially increasing flexibility.

Progress has been slow, however, and the market remains dominated by proprietary solutions from Ericsson, Nokia, and Huawei, although the latter has been hit by government restrictions in countries including Britain.

Vodafone agreed in 2022 to work with U.S. chipmaker Intel on the potential to design its own chip architecture.

The company's director of network architecture Santiago Tenorio confirmed the partners would jointly create chipsets at its campus in Malaga, Spain.

The chipsets will be available to smaller third-party vendors to test their own algorithms without a large financial outlay in silicon, Tenorio said at the FYUZ industry event in Madrid.

He said the ability to produce silicon designs in testing sample quantities would significantly speed up the time to deliver innovation.

""Combining Vodafone's networking expertise with Intel's strength in silicon architecture design will enable rapid prototyping, verification and testing, eventually leading to a faster mass production of the chips the industry needs to accelerate,"" he said.

Vodafone and Orange said on Monday they had successfully made 4G calls over a cluster of sites in a rural area near Bucharest based on Open RAN technology.

The two companies used hardware and software provided by Samsung, Wind River and Dell in the pilot, they said.

In Italy, Vodafone said a pilot with Nokia aimed to prove that Nokia's Open RAN solution could achieve the same functionality and performance as its purpose built RAN.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Apollo, JB Capital preparing bid for Vodafone's Spanish unit, Expansion says","MADRID (Reuters) - U.S.-based buyout fund Apollo Global Management is readying a bid with local fund JB Capital for the Spanish unit of telecom giant Vodafone, the Expansion newspaper reported on Monday citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the matter.

The news about a potential bid comes three weeks after British telecom investment company Zegona said it was in talks with Vodafone to buy the Spanish unit.

European stocks retreat as oil soars on Middle East conflict,"Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Monday, as investors assessed the implications of the military conflict in the Middle East and the associated surge in oil prices.

At 03:25 ET (07:25 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 1.1% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. fell 0.3%, supported to a degree by its heavily-weighted oil majors.

Oil soars on Middle East conflict escalation
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalated to full-blown war over the weekend, as members of the Islamist group Hamas attacked several Israeli towns, killing hundreds of Israelis and abducted dozens more. In response, Israeli air strikes pounded numerous targets in Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties.

This new source of conflict, with the Ukrainian war still ongoing, has seen oil prices surge, to the detriment of most European stock markets. The higher oil prices could add to inflationary pressures, prompting more central bank tightening, and also acts as a tax on consumers.

The benchmark Brent and Nymex contracts gained as much as 5%, before slipping slightly back, just when prices had been on the retreat.

Last week saw oil prices post their steepest weekly losses since March, as Brent posted a decline of about 11% and WTI recorded an over 8% drop, on worries that persistently high interest rates will slow global growth and hammer fuel demand.

At 03:25 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 3.3% higher at $85.51 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 2.9% to $87.00 a barrel.

German industrial production weakened in August
Data released earlier Monday showed that German industrial production fell 0.2% on the month in August.

Although this represents an improvement from the revised 0.6% drop the previous month, Germany, the eurozone�s dominant economy, has a high exposure to energy costs, and thus a sustained rise in oil prices would be an unwelcome blow.

Additionally, this is the fourth consecutive month this sector has retreated, stoking recession fears.
