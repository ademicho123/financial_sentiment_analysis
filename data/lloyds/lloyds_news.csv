Oaktree Inks £1 Billion Private Credit Tie-Up with Lloyds Bank,"Oaktree Capital Management is partnering with Lloyds Banking Group Plc to provide the banking giant’s private equity clients with loans to fund their buyouts, the latest sign that traditional lenders are trying to find creative ways to get into private credit.

Oaktree will provide the bank’s buyout fund customers with loans of as much as £175 million ($227 million) as part of the deal, according to a statement. The two are planning to deploy £1 billion in the coming years.

“Sponsor clients will be able to finance larger transactions without needing to bring on board additional lenders,” James Ranger, head of structured finance and syndicate at Lloyds, said in the statement.

With the move, Lloyds joins a slew of rivals that have sought to muscle in on the $1.7 trillion private credit industry. Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. have announced plans to cobble together more than $50 billion to plow into private credit in recent months, according to a Bloomberg analysis earlier this year.

For years, banks complained that direct lenders would unseat them by luring away clients and siphoning off corporate-loan business. Now, though, many banks have found it more profitable to earn fees by taking money from investors to fund the loans, rather than agreeing to put up money themselves.

With the Oaktree deal, Lloyds is planning to contribute a portion of its own capital to fund the loans. The Financial Times earlier reported on the partnership.

At Oaktree, the partnership will be handled by the European private debt platform, which has deployed over $3.9 billion in the last two decades. Lloyds’ end will be handled by the bank’s structured debt finance team.

“Providing financing solutions to sponsor-backed companies in the UK remains a significant long-term opportunity,” said Nael Khatoun, portfolio manager within Oaktree’s European private debt strategy."

switching current accounts
switching current accounts
At any one time, you’ll usually be able to find at least a couple of current account switching perks on offer, often giving you the chance to bag some free cash with just a few clicks.

Banks and building societies run this type of promotion from time to time in a bid to entice new customers in.

Right now, there are only a couple of deals up for grabs, just for moving your current account from your existing provider to a new one.

Andrew Hagger, personal finance expert from Moneycomms, said: “The switching incentives are more attractive than ever. The ‘£100-deals’ will no longer cut it, as most providers are offering almost double that amount these days.”

Equally, while a one-off bonus may sound pretty appealing, if you’re prepared to put in the legwork, there’s potentially some serious money to be made by repeatedly switching accounts – as long as you carefully navigate the banks’ various terms and conditions.

The biggest switching incentives
Barclays: £175
If you’re a new customer switch to a Barclays Bank Account or Premier Current Account by August 30, you’ll be able to benefit from Barclays’ current £175 incentive.

There are some conditions to fulfil. Firstly, if you opt for the Barclays Bank Account, you’ll need to sign up to the provider’s Blue Rewards scheme, which costs £5 a month (but comes with perks such as Apple TV, cashback and more).

The Premier Current Account is fee-free, but requires you to either pay in a gross annual income of at least £75,000, or have a total balance of at least £100,000 in savings or investments held with Barclays.

You need to switch at least two direct debits to the account, have started the process by August 30 and pay in at least £800 to the account by that date.

The bonus cash should be paid into your account within 28 days.

First Direct: £175
First Direct has reintroduced its popular switching bonus, offering new customers £175 when they move to its current account – but there are a lot of restrictions to bear in mind.

To get the bonus, you must make the switch using the Current Account Switching Service (CASS), and within 30 days of the new account opening you’ll need to transfer at least two direct debits, a balance of at least £1,000, use your debit card at least five times and login to digital banking.

The payment will only be made to those who have never held a First Direct product, or held a current account with HSBC since January 1 2018.

There is no specific date when the offer will be withdrawn, but it’s understood to only be around for a “limited time”.

Lloyds Bank: £175
Lloyds Bank’s switching offer is available until July 30, so you’ll need to be quick if you want to take advantage. You’ll need to move to a new Club Lloyds, Club Lloyds Silver or Club Lloyds Platinum account, moving at least three direct debits with you.

Note that these accounts can come with monthly fees; Club Lloyds Silver is £11.50 a month and Club Lloyds Platinum has a monthly fee of £22.50; all three accounts come with an additional £3 monthly Club Lloyds fee, but this is waived if you pay in at least £2,000.

Anyone who has received a switching incentive from Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland or Halifax since April 2020 won’t qualify.

The money should be paid quickly – within 10 days of satisfying the eligibility criteria.

Always switch via the CASS
To qualify for the free cash handouts, you have to go down the “official” transfer route, and this means using the Current Account Switch Service (CASS).

This is a free scheme which aims to take the hassle out of switching, with the process completed in seven working days. While most banks are signed up, not all of them are, so you’ll need to check availability when you’re looking to move.

All payments going out, such as direct debits, and those coming in, such as your salary, will be moved for you. Any payments accidentally made or requested from the old account after you’ve moved will be automatically redirected.

There is also a guarantee that acts as a safety net if anything goes wrong, meaning you will receive a refund of interest and charges on both your old and new accounts.

Mr Hagger said: “The CASS has given many consumers the confidence to ditch their existing bank.”

Check qualifying terms
As we’ve noted earlier, there can sometimes be several hoops to jump through in order to qualify for a switching bonus; if this is a big part of why you want to move accounts then it’s worth ensuring you meet all the criteria laid down by your chosen provider.

Mr Hagger added: “This might mean ensuring you credit the account with a certain amount each month, or checking you have the right number of direct debits or standing orders set up on the account.”

If you’re a regular current account switcher, you’ll likely need to avoid going back to the same provider – or group of providers – for a few years before you’re able to get another switching bonus.

Kate Brain, banking expert at ratings firm Defaqto, said: “Be mindful that most providers do stipulate that if you have held an account with them within the last year or two, you won’t qualify for the cashback.”

First Direct, for example, will only pay out a bonus once, so no returning customers can benefit.

The key is to read the full terms before you agree to switch.

How to become a serial switcher
If you’re savvy with your money, and have the time to dedicate to regularly scouring switching offers, there’s decent cash to be earned by switching more than once.

Mr Hagger said: “If you’re comfortable opening and closing bank accounts, and happy with the idea of getting new debit cards, account numbers, sort codes, PINs, new online banking set-ups and passwords, then there’s money to be made.”

This trick involves cashing in on all of the available switching deals – so it makes sense to time it for whenever there are several available.

Better still, further deals may appear in the weeks to come. By the time you get to the end of the process of switching to these providers, you could find there are fresh offers available from the other banks, meaning you could potentially earn even more.

Before you get excited, don’t bank on having that cash to spend right away.

Ms Brain added: “While the CASS means you can switch accounts within seven days, be aware that some of the conditions mean it does take longer for the money to be paid out.”

One tip she recommends for “serial switchers” is to think about opening a separate account from your main current account. So, keeping some direct debits and spending in one account that you hold more consistently, while transferring others around. This can be a help if you are concerned about transferring all your outgoings.

How exactly do you switch bank accounts?
Once you’ve found a new account you’d like to move to, compare it against other offerings, just to be sure you’re making the right choice.

Then, check that you’re eligible for the account, and the switching offer.

If you’re happy that you qualify, all you need to do is open the new account and let your new provider know you’re switching over. It should only take a matter of minutes to fill out the form.

Your new bank will then do all the legwork for you. This includes transferring all your direct debits and standing orders being transferred to your new account.

It’s then down to you to select the date you want your account switched, and down to your former bank to take care of closing your old account.

Top tips for switching bank accounts
While the CASS aims to make the switching process as seamless as possible, it can still be a little disruptive – but there are things you can do to make sure you don’t lose track of your payments.

Download your bank statements
Before your old account gets shut down, download your bank statements from the last few months. That way, you will have them if you need them – they might be required if you need to remortgage or apply for another kind of borrowing, for example.

Assess your direct debits
Seize the opportunity to make a note of all your direct debits, standing orders and subscriptions, so you know you’ve moved everything over. Also use this as a chance to look for better deals, and weed out any payments for services you no longer use.

Hold off setting up new payments
In the few days while the switching process is taking place, don’t set up any regular payments from your old account, as they may not be moved over.

Check your overdraft eligibility
If you have an overdraft with your existing provider, you will need to speak to your new bank first to see if this facility can be agreed on your new account. Borrowing rules can vary between providers, so don’t assume you’ll be able to get the same amount of overdraft.

Consider your credit score
While switching accounts shouldn’t affect your credit score, tread carefully if you are thinking of taking out a mortgage or loan in the near future. Mortgage providers and other lenders don’t like to see too many accounts opened in a short space of time, as this could suggest money problems. With this in mind, avoid switching providers too frequently ahead of applying for any type of borrowing.

Seen an offer you like? Don’t delay
If you decide one of the accounts offering a cash incentive is right for you, you need to act fast, as these latest switching deals may not hang around for long.

Rachel Springall, from Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said: “Switching bonuses come and go. There is no guarantee such lucrative perks will remain on offer forever.”

That being said, it’s also important to research any deals carefully before making any decision.

Ms Springall added: “Consumers may be tempted to grab a free cash perk, but it is imperative you weigh up the overall package on offer before committing to any new account.”

It’s not all about the money; your current account is likely to be the financial service you use most often, so you also need to be sure the account suits you, and the way you manage your finances. If, for instance, you’re switching to an online-only bank, when you value visiting a branch, then the switch may not be the best decision."
Which looks the better bank buy right now: Lloyds or NatWest shares?,"Simon Watkins

Lloyds (LSE: LLOY) shares remain one of the most popular FTSE 100 investor picks.

However, many other stocks in the leading index look like better buys right now to me. These include fellow bank NatWest (LSE: NWG).

Dividend returns
Lloyds paid a total dividend in 2023 of 2.76p a share. This yields 4.7% on the current 59p share price. NatWest paid 17p a share, which yields 5.3% on its present share price of £3.23.

It might not look much on paper, but the difference in dividend payments over the years is considerable. This is particularly true if the dividends are ‘compounded’ (used to buy more of each stock).

After 10 years on an average yield of 4.7%, £10,000 invested in Lloyds shares would make another £5,985. The same amount in NatWest shares would add £6,970.

Over 30 years on the same basis, an additional £30,847 would have been made from the Lloyds stake. The NatWest holding would have generated an extra £38,866!

Yields go up and down as share prices move and dividend payments change, of course. However, as it stands, it is a win in this category for NatWest.

Business outlook
A company’s revenues drive share price and dividends long term, but there is nothing to separate the banks here. Analysts estimate that each will see their revenues grow by 3.2% each year to end-2027.

Each is likely to see its interest margins between deposits and loans drop, as UK inflation and interest rates decline.

Lloyds faces an additional risk of big compensation payouts over the mis-selling of car loans through its Black Horse business.

That said, this does not tip the overall balance to NatWest in this category in my view, so it is a draw.

Relative undervaluation
Lloyds shares currently trade on the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) share valuation measure at 8.2. This is the most overvalued among its peer group, the average P/E of which is 7.3.

NatWest is at the bottom of this peer group valuation table, presently trading at just 6.4. So it is the most undervalued on this basis.

I used a discounted cash flow to work out how cheap NatWest shares are in cash terms.

On this, they are 50% undervalued right now. So a fair value for them would be £6.44.

It does not necessarily mean they will trade there – it may be lower or higher. But it highlights how undervalued they look.

A second clear victory for NatWest – so two out of three for it, in my view.

Will I buy the shares?
I already own shares in NatWest and HSBC. These were bought at much lower price levels, so I am happy with them.

If I did not already have these, I would buy them today without hesitation. Both have a better mix of growth prospects, undervalued shares, and good yields than Lloyds shares, in my view.

"Up 31%, do Lloyds shares have more to give?","Shares in banking giant Lloyds (LSE: LLOY) have taken off the in the last year.

The stock is up 22.3% year to date and 31.1% over the last 12 months. Patient shareholders, myself included, have been waiting a long time for the FTSE 100 bank to take it up a gear. It seems to me that’s finally happening.

But Lloyds’ impressive rise in the last year has me pondering what’s next for the stock. It’s nearing the 60p mark. Could it gallop past that with ease? Could 70p be on the horizon? Let’s explore.

Valuation
Even after its rise, Lloyds still looks like decent value for money. It has a price-to-earnings ratio of 10.2. Looking ahead, that falls to 8.2 for 2025 and 6.9 for 2026. As the chart below shows, its price-to-book ratio, at 0.9, sits just below the benchmark for fair value, which is 1.



Created with TradingView

Lloyds stock isn’t as cheap as it has been. That’s especially after its rally in the last week or so following the general election.

When I picked up some shares in July last year, they were trading on a measly six times earnings. What’s more, as seen below, in the last year its dividend yield has risen as high as 6.3%. That’s a lot bulkier than today’s 4.7%.



Created with TradingView

A bright future
But that doesn’t mean Lloyds wouldn’t be a savvy buy today. Investors are clearly looking ahead to what could be a prosperous period for the bank. And rightly so.

We have some stability now with Labour’s recent landslide win. Stability is massive for investor confidence and more widely the economy. Lloyds derives its revenues solely from the UK. While that poses a risk as its reliant on the domestic economy performing, it also means when it excels then so does Lloyds.

The housing market has also been under immense pressure over the last couple of years, but many are optimistic we’ll begin to see signs of this pressure easing in the coming months. That should drive demand for mortgages, which — given Lloyds’ position as the UK’s largest mortgage lender — should provide it with a boost.

Margins
Of course, the bank’s recent share-price surge has also been boosted by expanding margins due to larger interest rates. When the Bank of England starts cutting them, which could be as early as next month, Lloyds’ margins will shrink. We were given a warning sign of this in Q1. For the period its underlying net interest income fell by 10% to £3.2bn, including a lower net interest margin of 2.95%.

I’d buy more
Even so, I’d still buy more Lloyds shares today if I had the cash and I reckon its shares have more to give. The upcoming months have the potential to be prosperous and although I’d imagine that’s already baked into its share price, I still think the stock looks good value.

Am I expecting a similar performance over the next 12 months? No. But am I optimistic Lloyds could be a great staple for my portfolio in the years and, hopefully, decades to come? Most certainly.

Its 4.7% yield may not be as attractive as it was but is still a healthy stream of extra income.

Disused Lloyds office sites to be converted into social housing,"Lloyds Banking Group will start converting its disused office sites into social housing, as the UK’s largest mortgage provider lays the groundwork for a fresh housebuilding boom after Labour’s election win.

The bank, which started reviewing its property portfolio during the Covid lockdown in 2020, is launching the programme with a decommissioned data and office space in Pudsey, West Yorkshire.

Lloyds will sell the site to a local housing group with the agreement that 80 new homes will then be rented at about half the usual rate. Lloyds said it was assessing other potential offices and datacentres in the UK that it could do something similar with.

Related: Labour cannot build 1.5m homes without cash for affordable housing, providers say

Meanwhile, Lloyds announced it was also expanding its Citra Living private rental arm to become the first UK bank in the affordable housing market. Citra, which was launched in 2021 to diversify income from traditional lending, will buy the homes and remain the landlord, while local authorities take on everyday management. The pilot will start in Cambridge next month, with rentals offered to struggling households at 80% of market rates.

It is part of a wider package of measures announced by the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, as he prepares to host housing bosses and policymakers for an inaugural social housing forum in London on Monday, where he will continue calls to build 1m social and affordable homes.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged to build 1.5m new homes to address the UK’s housing crisis over the next five years. While Labour has not yet detailed how many of those homes will be offered social or affordable rates, Nunn said he was cautiously hopeful that the party would achieve more than the Tory party was able to during its 14 years in office.

“Labour’s commitment to it is clearer than the last government,” Nunn told the Guardian. “We obviously didn’t see, in the last period of time, some of the changes that would be needed to really unlock the level of the ambition that we think is needed for the UK to prosper going forward.”

Sceptics will question why a commercial lender would be willing to sacrifice larger profits, especially at a time when interest rates are expected to drop and eat into bank earnings.

One reason is that affordable homes are a reliable source of income. With UK households facing a chronic shortage of new homes and near-record house prices, there will be consistent demand for affordable housing.

Affordable rents can make it easier for people to save up a deposit to eventually buy a home. That could indirectly benefit Lloyds, which owns the Halifax brand and is the UK’s largest mortgage lender. “When you’re in the affordable space, [which is] the low end of the private rental space, we think that’s a really important pathway to home ownership,” Nunn said.

Citra also launched its first rent-to-buy scheme last year.

Nunn insisted there were no plans to package up and securitise the projects, which would involve bundling affordable rental contracts and selling off slices to investors on the open market.

However, Lloyds may end up seeking co-investors, particularly insurers and pension providers, that are also on the hunt for reliable returns for savers and retirees. That could also involve deploying retirement savings from Lloyds’ Scottish Widows arm.

“All pension plans have 30- or 40-year or 50-year payouts that they’re managing. There is that opportunity to put a percentage of that money into a long-term investment, like housing. So that’s not packaging them up or securitising … that’s actually putting them as a bedrock of a stable source of returns for pensioners,” Nunn said.

Lloyds is also ring-fencing £200m worth of loans for small housing providers who would otherwise struggle to access funding. Nunn admitted there was a “low return hurdle”, meaning Lloyds is prepared to make less money on the loans than usual, but he insisted that it was “a return that does meet our shareholders expectations”.

Nunn is now hoping his social housing forum, scheduled less than two weeks after the general election, gains the attention of the new Labour government.

That could open the door to talks with Nunn’s social housing initiative group, which includes bosses from Homes England, Legal & General, the housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes, the homelessness charity Crisis, as well as local authorities and housing associations.

“I’d like to get a chance to engage on the policy agenda because we now have a group of people who have got really specific ideas,” Nunn said."
Surely the Lloyds share price has gone too high?,"The Lloyds (LSE:LLOY) share price has risen to new post-pandemic heights with Labour’s landslide election win pushing the stock higher.

The British lender stock is now up 32.97% over the past 12 months, and this may lead many investors to question whether Lloyds is getting a little expensive.

Not as cheap as it used to be
Lloyds stock isn’t clearly undervalued in the way that it was. The stock is currently trading at just 5.6% below its share price target. A year ago, the average share price target suggested that Lloyds was trading at a near-40% discount.

It’s worth recognising that the average share price target, which is comprised of all analysts’ forecasts, isn’t always correct. In fact, sometimes it can be way off.

However, it’s also the case that Lloyds’ valuation metrics are no longer as cheap as they once were. The stock is currently trading at 10.2 times forward earnings, instead of around five times a year ago.

Moving forward to 2025, Lloyds is trading at 8.2 times expected earnings. This falls to 6.9 times in 2026 as earnings improve further.

Fresh hope for the valuation gap
UK-listed stocks trade with significant discounts to their US-listed counterparts in pretty much all sectors, with the current exception of defence. This is called the valuation gap.

Banking, however, is no exception. Here’s how Lloyds compares to US-listed peers JPMorgan and Bank of America on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) basis.

P/E 24

P/E 25

P/E 26

Lloyds

8.2

6.9

Bank of America

13.1

12.5

11.4

JPMorgan

12.6

12.3

12.3

Lloyds is substantially cheaper than these American peers. In fact, the data doesn’t show the full depth of the valuation gap, and that’s partially because Lloyds looks more expensive than usual for 2024 because earnings will be impacted by fines and a rise in corporation tax.

I’m wondering, and I believe many institutions and analysts are doing the same, if this valuation gap may shrink in the coming years. And, yes, politics is part of the equation.

Labour-run Britain is starting to look like an island of stability in an increasingly polarised and non-centrist world. Stability is vital for investment, confidence, and the economy as a whole, and Lloyds is often seen as a barometer for the UK economy.

So, does this mean the valuation gap will become smaller? Well, there’s more hope than there has been.

However, it’s worth bearing in mind that Lloyds is a much less diversified offering than its big-name American peers. It doesn’t have an investment arm and only operates in the UK.

That’s a concern for some investors at a time when interest rates are high and some customers are struggling to repay their loans/mortgages.

Less diversification means more risk, and more risk means cheaper valuation.

Is Lloyds overvalued?
Valuation data is open to interpretation. Sometimes a stock at 120 times earnings — like Nvidia a year ago — can actually be better value than a company in decline that trades at five times earnings.

Personally, I don’t think Lloyds is overvalued. And that’s purely because the valuation data is still heavily discounted relative to American peers, earnings strengthen over the medium term, and the dividend yield is an attractive 4.7%.

"At 58p, is Lloyds actually a penny stock? And is it a buy today?","Since 2009, Lloyds Banking Group (LSE:LLOY) has often been described as a penny stock. That certainly makes sense, given the share price has continued to trade below 100p over the last 15 years. And even in 2024, after enjoying a 20% rally, shares are still only trading around 58p.

However, despite appearances, Lloyds isn’t a penny stock. Why? Because its market capitalisation is £36.6bn. That makes it one of the largest companies on the London Stock Exchange.

By comparison, penny stocks are often relatively tiny enterprises with market-caps sitting below £100m. They’re also notoriously volatile – which doesn’t really describe this bank, given the stock has hovered around the 50p mark for over a decade.

Those traits don’t exactly make penny stocks sound all that inviting. Yet, there’s one thing that these firms have in ample supply that Lloyds has been seriously lacking – growth potential. Given time, a successful startup can evolve into a new industry titan, delivering ginormous returns to shareholders who spotted the opportunity early on.

A shifting landscape
As previously highlighted, the Lloyds share price hasn’t exactly been delivering staggering returns of late. Even after taking dividends into consideration, the bank has underperformed the FTSE 100 index by quite a wide margin.

There are a lot of factors at play contributing to this lacklustre display. However, the most significant is undoubtedly the collapse of interest rates. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, interest rates were cut to near zero percent to reduce pressure on both business and personal loans.

However, as a consequence, banks like Lloyds have struggled to generate a meaningful profit margin through their lending programmes, especially mortgages. The bank’s tried to make up the difference in volume. But with British home construction targets constantly being missed, there are only so many mortgages the bank can sell.

Now that interest rates have gone up considerably, Lloyd’s net interest margins are far more favourable resulting in the bottom line surging. Sadly, rate cuts are expected to emerge in the near future now that inflation’s almost back under control. A return to near-zero rates is unlikely. But looming rate cuts nonetheless will start to reintroduce pressure on Lloyd’s profit margins once more.

Finding quality penny stocks
Despite the challenges, Lloyds has one trait that almost all penny stocks crave – cash flow. Small businesses are often hit the hardest during economic downturns simply due to a lack of access to financial resources. And that’s why when investing in small-caps, I’m always hunting for the firms that already have an established revenue stream with high levels of cash conversion.

Apart from protecting against market downturns, cash flow grants management teams far more flexibility in capital allocation. And that can be a huge boon when competing against other start-ups that operate with far more financial restrictions.

Obviously, being a cash-generative enterprise isn’t the only trait that defines a winning penny stock. But as a filter, it can immediately eliminate lacklustre businesses from consideration, and helps investors avoid falling into traps.

As for Lloyds, its shares continue to be at the mercy of interest rates, which are beyond management’s control. Personally, I prefer investing in businesses that are in more control of their own destiny. Therefore, it’s not a stock I’m tempted to buy right now.

"At 52-week highs, here’s what may be next for the Lloyds share price","Lloyds Banking Group (LSE:LLOY) shares have been doing very well recently. Up 35% over the past year, the Lloyds share price hit fresh 52-week highs earlier this week. Even though there are solid reasons for the rally, I think some are now focusing on what’s next for the stock. From my research, here’s what I think lies in store through to the end of this year.

The recent past
Even though past performance is no guarantee of future returns, I can look at what has driven the stock so far this year and go from there.

From my perspective, one of the main drivers has been the Bank of England’s policy committee pushing back on rate cut expectations. Coming into this year, I thought we would have seen our first rate cut in the spring. Yet here we are in July with the base rate still above 5%.

This extra period of high interest rates has help Lloyds to enjoy elevated profits for longer. It’s true that the Q1 results showed the net interest margin had fallen from 3.22% a year ago to 2.95% now. But this is still well above where it was during the pandemic.

Further, the UK economy has done better than some of us expected. Data out yesterday (11 July) showed that GDP grew by 0.4% in May, double the 0.2% gain that was forecast. The Lloyds share price is a bellwether for the broader economy, as it banks a large retail client base. So based on how active these customers are in spending and taking loans out, it’s reflected in the stock.

Looking ahead
I think that if the economic data continues to show the UK economy is doing well, the stock can keep rallying in H2.

Some flag up that interest rate cuts are coming, and this is a risk for the share price. I partially agree here, but do want to point something out. Lower interest rates will reduce the net interest income. But on the other hand, lower rates will boost demand for mortgage products and other loans. So the actual negative impact overall could be less than people might think.

At the end of this month we get the half year results. This will also be a factor in determining where the stock heads for the rest of the year. Yet if it keeps to the guidance that it issued last quarter, I don’t see it being a a problem for the share price.

Even though we recently hit the 52-week highs, I wouldn’t say the firm is overvalued as we start H2. The price-to-earnings ratio is just 7.64. This is below the benchmark figure of 10 I use as a fair value. So there’s room to run higher for the share price even if the earnings per share figure stays the same.

The next six months
Trying to predict the future isn’t easy. I’ve based my forecasts on my own subjective viewpoint. The risk is that I’ve missed some key factors that could make the stock fall in coming months. But based on my view, I think the Lloyds share price continues to head higher from here. On that basis, I’m thinking of adding the bank to my portfolio.

Best UK savings accounts offering above inflation rates,"UK households are always looking for ways to make their money go further amid the cost of living crisis and savings accounts can help.

After years of low rates, high-yield savings accounts are having a moment as the Bank of England has kept interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%. While homeowners face higher mortgages, there is a silver lining in higher borrowing costs and consumers can now find UK savings accounts offering higher than inflation rates.

The UK rate of inflation came in at 2% in May for the first time in nearly three years, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Savers should shop around to find the best deals and check what rate they are on – as they could still be sitting on a product that does not beat inflation.

The main factor you should be aware of when choosing a savings account is the difference between easy-access and fixed-term.

Read more: Is the Bank of England expected to cut interest rates in August?

Easy-access accounts allow you to access your money when you need it. Fixed-term, as the name implies, are accounts where you can’t access your cash for the duration of the deal. They usually offer better rates, but you must be comfortable with not touching your savings for a long period, usually between one and five years.

What are the best high-interest fixed-rate accounts?
The best fixed-rate account currently offers 5.25% and is available from the Access Bank UK.

The Access Bank offers 5.25% in a one-year account. The fixed-term personal savings account requires a minimum of £5,000 to be locked for 12 months. You can invest up to £500,000. Withdrawals are not allowed for the duration of the deal and you can only open it online or by post.


The Union Bank is offering a one-year fixed-rate deal that pays 5.22%. It requires a minimum of £1,000 and you can invest up to £1,000,000. Withdrawals are not allowed for the duration of the deal.

Smart Save has a one-year fixed rate deal that pays 5.21% but requires a minimum of £10,000. You can invest up to £85,000. Withdrawals are not allowed for the duration of the deal.

Online banks typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar branches, which translate into better returns, giving you a more efficient way to save and reach financial goals.

If you prefer to go with a familiar name, the high-street lenders have slightly lower offers, but are still above inflation.

Barclays (BARC.L) offers the highest rate among high-street lenders, with a one-year fixed-rate savings account that pays 4.65%. The requirements aren't too stringent, with the minimum balance required being £500.

Metro Bank isn’t far off with its 4.61% interest rate and similar conditions. The account has a one-year fixed term and the minimum you have to pay in is £500.

Lloyds (LLOY.L) has a fixed-rate savings product offering 4.35% for one year. However, the minimum deposit is £3,000 and you must have or open a Lloyds current account or a different savings account to be eligible. For new clients, the interest is 4.15%.

How do fixed-rate savings accounts work?
Unlike easy-access savings, where interest rates can vary, fixed-rate accounts earn a set rate of interest for the period you choose, whether that's six months or one, two, three or even five years. Those are the most common deals, but some offers go up to 10 years and over.

You must leave your initial deposit for a fixed period without making withdrawals. If you touch your money, you forfeit any interest.

What are the best easy-access savings accounts?
Easy-access savings accounts let you withdraw your money without notice. With that ease of access comes lower interest rates, but they are a good option for those who think they might need their money in a hurry.

"Up 37% in the last year, should I be watching the Lloyds share price?","The Lloyds (LSE:LLOY) share price has been a real winner for investors in the UK banking sector, surging 37% over the past year.

This performance has outpaced both the broader UK market, which returned 10.7%, and other UK banks, with an average of 17.5%. With such strong momentum, investors might be wondering if Lloyds deserves a spot on their watchlist. Let’s dive into the details.

A banking giant
Founded in 1695, Lloyds has stood the test of time, evolving into one of the UK’s largest financial institutions. The group offers a wide range of banking and financial services across three main segments: Retail, Commercial Banking, and Insurance, Pensions and Investments.

This giant of the market boasts a market capitalisation of £36.3bn. However, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 8.1 times. This relatively low P/E suggests the stock might be undervalued compared to its earnings potential.

Additionally, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of just 0.8 times indicates that the market values the firm at less than its book value, potentially representing a bargain for value investors. Of course, these are just two metrics, but they definitely have me interested.

Growing strength
Lloyds’ financial health appears robust, with earnings growing by 18.8% over the past year. The company reported earnings of £4.49bn on revenues of £18.18bn, demonstrating a very healthy net profit margin of 24.71%. Furthermore, analysts forecast earnings to grow at a steady pace of 4.85% per year, suggesting continued profitability.

For income-focused investors, the bank offers a tempting proposition with its current dividend yield of 4.7%. The pay-out ratio stands at 39%, indicating that the dividend is well-covered by earnings and potentially sustainable. So far, this one is ticking all the boxes for steady growth. And management’s planning for the future.

Areas of concern
While the balance sheet and recent performance paint a fairly attractive picture, I feel like potential investors should be aware of some risks. The banking sector’s highly sensitive to economic conditions and interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, Lloyds’ high debt-to-equity ratio of 317.9% suggests a significant level of leverage, which could become problematic in a downturn. With the shares having such a healthy run, and political uncertainty still lingering, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some bumps in the road ahead.

According to a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, the company’s undervalued by about 10%. Of course, this is nothing to be sniffed at. But I’d worry if I was to invest now, the best of the growth is already behind me. Many investors may be looking to take profits soon, and put money to work elsewhere.

One for my watchlist
The company’s market-beating returns, coupled with its dividend yield and growth prospects, could appeal to both value and income investors. However, with the banking sector’s cyclical nature and high debt levels, I think that there might be more lucrative investments out there.

I’ll be keeping Lloyds on my watchlist for now though.

Best UK mortgage deals of the week,"Mortgage rates eased slightly amid hopes of an interest rate cut in August, but prospective homeowners are still struggling to find a deal they can afford, with more taking loans well into retirement.

The average rate on a two-year fixed deal this week stood at 5.99%, same as last week, while rates for a five-year deal came in at 5.45%, lower last week's 5.49%, according to figures from Uswitch.

The Bank of England (BoE) has left UK interest rates on hold at a 16-year high of 5.25% for a seventh consecutive time but markets are hoping for an August cut.


With fewer BoE interest-rate cuts now expected in 2024 and with an impending announcement on interest rates, many of the big lenders kept their offers unchanged.

""This week we’ve seen lenders respond to their growing expectation of a bank rate cut in August, and likely the election results, with a host of rate cuts across two- and five-year products,” Kellie Steed, Uswitch's mortgage expert, told Yahoo Finance UK.

""While these have not been significant enough yet to influence the overall average rates, we can see that across the big six lenders, the average two-year fixed rate has fallen by just over one percentage point and the average five-year fixed deal by 0.08%.

""As the month progresses we’re likely to see more lenders follow suit, with Nationwide and Skipton both announcing cuts as high as 0.3% and 0.33% respectively to both their residential purchase and remortgage ranges today,” she added.

Meanwhile, young homebuyers are being forced to gamble with their retirement prospects by taking on ultra-long mortgages.

In the last three years, researchers have noted a surge in mortgage terms that see homeowners locked into mortgages running beyond the state pension age. This is particularly rife among those under 30, data from the BoE highlighted.

However, there might be some sign of relief as slowing inflation is likely to be well-received by homeowners and buyers pinning their hopes on a summer interest rate cut.

Inflation has fallen back to the Bank of England’s 2% target for the first time in nearly three years.


HSBC mortgage rates
Borrowers have long said goodbye to HSBC’s (HSBA.L) 3.99% for a five-year deal. The cheapest deal at the lender’s table is now 4.22% for five years.

Looking at the two-year options, the lowest rate comes in at 4.67%, with a £999 fee.

Both cases assume a 60% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage, meaning buyers need to have at least 40% for a deposit.

The lender offers 95% LTV deals, meaning you only need to save for a 5% deposit. However, the rates are much higher, with a two-year fix coming in at 5.94% or 5.39% for a five-year fix.

This is because the rate someone can get will be determined by their financial situation and the size of their deposit. The larger the deposit, the lower the LTV, allowing buyers to access better deals because lenders consider them less risky.

NatWest mortgage rates
NatWest (NWG.L) has some of the cheapest deals on the market but no offer comes close to its previous 3.94% offer.

The best rates prospective borrowers can now get is an online-only deal offering 4.26% for a five-year deal with a £1,495 fee, assuming a 60% LTV. However, after five years the rate almost doubles to 8.24%.

It offers 4.35% for green mortgages — this product is available for properties with an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of A or B, where the fee drops to £995.

For a two-year fix, the cheapest a customer can get is 4.78% online, with a product fee of £1,495.

Santander mortgage rates
Santander (BNC.L) has also moved away from its under 4% mortgage with a five-year fix coming in at 4.20%, assuming you have a 40% deposit.

A 60% LTV two-year fixed rate with a £999 purchase fee comes in at 4.64%. A 75% LTV two-year fixed rate with a £999 purchase fee is priced at 4.72%. This is the lowest two-year fix on the market for those buying with a 25% deposit.

Last week, Santander implemented a raft of rate cuts across its fixed rate deals by up to 0.16 percentage points, aimed at home buyers.

“This move from Santander has the potential to ramp up the rate battle between the UK's biggest lenders”, Stephen Perkins, managing director at Yellow Brick Mortgages, told Newspage.

""More cuts are now likely ahead of the expected base rate reduction in August. Things are really hotting up now in the mortgage market.""

Barclays mortgage rates
Barclays (BARC.L) used to have the cheapest five-year deal for prospective homebuyers with a 40% deposit (60% LTV) that came in at 4.17%, with an £899 fee. No more — the lender has hiked the rate for that deal to 4.23%, where it has been for the past weeks.

When it comes to two-year mortgage deals, the lowest you can get is 4.68%.

Nationwide mortgage rates
At Nationwide (NBS.L), five-year purchase fixed rates start from 4.26%, with a £999 fee for borrowers with at least a 40% deposit.

Assuming a £300,000 house where you need to borrow £180,000, this puts monthly payments at £1,014.

The lender has improved its deals across a number of fixes. For first-time buyers it has implemented reductions of up to 0.09% across two and three-year fixed rate products up to 85% LTV, including:

Three-year fixed rate at 60% LTV with a £999 fee is 4.65% (reduced by 0.09%)

Three-year fixed rate at 75% LTV with a £999 fee is 4.75% (reduced by 0.04%)

Two-year fixed rate at 60% LTV with a £1,499 fee is 4.75% (reduced by 0.04%)

Halifax mortgage rates
Halifax, the UK’s biggest mortgage lender, has cut some of its deals as the market anticipates a rate cut next month.

The lender, owned by Lloyds (LLOY.L), offers a two-year fixed rate of 4.63% with a £999 fee for first-time buyers. This is the lowest two-year fix rate mortgage to individuals purchasing a property with a 40%.

The equivalent five-year rate starts at 4.26% (also 60% LTV), also unchanged.

It also offers a 10-year deal with a mortgage rate of 4.93%.

First Direct mortage rates
First Direct reduced the mortgage rates it is offering by up to 0.17 percentage points on Tuesday, following a slew of rate cuts by major lenders last week.

The bank has cut rates across its range of two-, three- and five-year fixed repayment mortgages, for first-time buyers and home movers.

The reductions include a cut on a two-year fixed-rate deal for people with a 15% deposit, which is now priced at 4.99%, down from 5.16%.

Liam O’Hara, head of mortgages at First Direct said: “We’re pleased to be reducing our rates across our range of two, three and five-year fixed mortgages, across LTVs from 60% to 95%.

“We see the highest demand for those products and today’s changes will help people making their first steps on the ladder, or those moving into their next home.”

Cheapest mortgage deal on the market
As under 4% mortgage rates are off the market, it makes it harder for prospective homeowners to say they’ve secured a good deal.

The 4.20% deal Santander offers appears to be one of the cheapest rates available but it requires a 40% deposit, so you will need a hefty amount of cash upfront to secure the deal. HSBC is close, with a 4.22% deal for a five-year fix.

Read more: Which first-time home buyer scheme is right for me?

Given the average UK house price sits at £261,962, a 40% deposit equates to about £105,000.

Borrowers would need to spread their home loans over more than 70 years to afford the same mortgages on offer just two years ago, banks have said.

There is also a new mortgage product promising to help first-time buyers get on the property ladder with just a £5,000 deposit.

Yorkshire Building Society is offering a deal that enables first-time buyers across England, Scotland and Wales with a £5,000 deposit to purchase a property valued at up to £500,000.

It means first-time buyers could get on the ladder with as little as 1% deposit.

Will mortgage rates go down in 2024?
Mortgage holders and debt borrowers have been forced to pay record high repayments in recent years due to the UK's hiked base rate being passed onto customers by banks and building societies. Until now, the consensus was that interest rates have peaked and that 2024 will see the Bank start to cut rates as inflation eases.

However, even with inflation falling to target, traders are now pricing in just one or two rate cuts, compared to expectations of five cuts at the start of 2024.

If the BoE makes any cuts this year, mortgage rates will come down, but not as much as expected for 2024. Markets are pricing one cut in August and maybe another one later in the year.

Nicholas Mendes, head of marketing and mortgage technical manager at John Charcol, said: “It’s important to note that until an official bank rate cut happens, lenders will exhibit mixed attitudes. Those with smaller pipelines may be more proactive in implementing reductions.”

About 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year."
"At 58p, could Lloyds shares help Britons build generational wealth?","Lloyds (LSE: LLOY) shares continue to trade well below their highs. Currently, they can be snapped up for just 58p each.

Could an investment in Lloyds today help to build generational wealth? Let’s discuss.

A cheap stock
Lloyds shares do look cheap relative to the market today. This year, analysts expect the bank to generate earnings per share of 6.4p. So, at the current share price, the forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just nine. That’s well below the market average of around 14 so there could be some value on offer here.

Meanwhile, there’s a decent dividend yield too. For 2024, Lloyds is forecast to pay out 3.2p per share. That means a yield of about 5.5%, higher than interest rates on offer from most savings accounts.

A poor long-term investment in the past
Yet if my goal was to build generational wealth (and it is), I’d be looking beyond Lloyds shares.

One reason for this is that Lloyds has a poor long-term track record when it comes to creating wealth for its investors due to the fact that its profits are volatile.

Ten years ago, the bank’s share price was 73p. Today, it’s 58p. In other words, over the last decade, the business hasn’t created any capital gains for its investors.

That’s very disappointing given that we have been in a huge global bull market for stocks.

Now, things could be different going forward, of course. But the stock’s track record doesn’t fill me with confidence.

Given the past performance, I wouldn’t expect to generate high returns from the shares in the future. Especially now that interest rates are likely to fall (higher rates are generally better for banks).

How I’m aiming to build wealth
So, how am I trying to build wealth for future generations?

Well, instead of snapping up cheap stocks, I’m investing in ‘high-quality’ stocks (just like Warren Buffett does).

I’m looking for companies that have:

A competitive advantage that gives them an edge over the competition

Consistent earnings growth

A high level of profitability

Strong long-term growth prospects

An excellent track record when it comes to generating shareholder wealth

History shows that these kinds of companies tend to be excellent long-term investments and can help to build generational wealth. Just look at Buffett. He’s now worth over $100m!

A good example of a high-quality company – and one that Buffett himself is invested in – is Visa (NYSE:V), which is listed in the US (but can still be bought for an ISA or SIPP).

Its business model (it operates a large global payments network) can’t easily be replicated. Meanwhile, it’s very profitable and has fantastic long-term growth prospects since the world is shifting from cash to electronic payments.

Over the last 10 years, its share price has risen from around $55 to $265. The company has also paid regular dividends. So, it has been a brilliant long-term investment overall.

Of course, there’s no guarantee that it will continue to outperform going forward. There’s a chance that its business model could be disrupted by technology.

I’m very bullish on the stock though. Currently, it’s a top 10 holding in my portfolio.

Is this as good as it gets for the Lloyds share price?,"I can’t believe the Lloyds (LSE: LLOY) share price. After declining for a decade, it’s finally pointing the right way. We’ve waited long enough.

Lloyds shares are up 36.95% over the past year, more than three times the 12.1% return on the FTSE 100 over the same period. They boast a trailing yield of 4.78%, lifting the total return to more than 40%.

Who saw that coming? I did, actually. I bought the shares in June and September last year, at an average price of 43.62p. Today, they trade at 57.84p, plus I’ve reinvested two dividends. I don’t often get my timing this right.

FTSE 100 income star
I felt the stock was due a revival but I didn’t expected it to happen while interest rates were still high, house prices stagnating, and consumer spending squeezed.

Yet it has. One reason is that investors are forward-looking. They think things will get better six to nine months down the line at which point rising wealth will drive up demand for savings and mortgage products.

Better still, this will cut debt impairments. In fact, that’s already happening. Lloyds now allocates just £57m to cover bad loans, against £243m last year.

Investors seem to be factoring in rather a lot of good news but the recovery will also bring challenges. When the Bank of England finally cuts base rates, this will erode Lloyds’ net interest margins, the difference between what it pays savers and charges borrowers. Margin compression has already begun and it hurts.

On 24 April, Lloyds reported that Q1 net interest margins had dropped from 3.22% to 2.95%, while operating expenses climbed. Profits fell 28% to £1.63bn. That doesn’t seem to bother investors. Lloyds’ shares have climbed 12% since then.

Investors have also chosen to ignore a potential motor finance mis-selling scandal, for which Lloyds has set aside a modest £450m. Any compensation bill could be much higher than that. Nobody knows.

This stock isn’t as cheap
Another problem is that the rising share price has driven down the yield. Last October, it spiked at 6.3%. Today it’s back down to 4.78%. That’s not bad, just not as good as it was. Let’s see what the chart says.



Chart by TradingView

Happily, markets forecast reckon the shares will yield 5.47% in 2025. Even better, they reckon net income will jump from £3.76bn in 2024 to £4.27bn in 2025.

Another concern is that Lloyds shares aren’t as cheap as they were. Today, they trade at 10.4 times 2024 earnings. I bought at close to six times. The price-to-book ratio has steadily climbed, too. Three years ago, it languished around 0.4. Today it’s close to fair value. Let’s see what the chart says.



Chart by TradingView

I have no intention of selling my Lloyd shares. I’ve got a pretty good allocation, and plan to hold onto them for years. Decades, if I’m lucky. Yet I won’t buy more today. I think other FTSE 100 high yielders now offer better comeback potential.

Lloyds Banking Group plc (LYG): Did This Bank Penny Stock Meet Expectations in Q1?","We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Bank Penny Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG) stands against the other bank penny stocks.

The US banking sector in 2024 faces various challenges and opportunities. Although the industry has recovered from the bank failures of early 2023, it now deals with a slower economy, tighter regulations, and the possibility of interest rate cuts, all of which present risks for the sector.

In the past year, the US banking sector observed the collapse of a couple of well-known banks, which led to uncertainty in regional bank stocks. When considering the broader context, last year's bank closures were not particularly notable in terms of quantity. The year's total of five closures pales in comparison to 2009 and 2010, which saw 140 and 157 closures, respectively. However, 2023 stood out due to the substantial total assets of the affected institutions, primarily driven by the significant sizes of First Republic Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank.

The banks were also heavily funded by uninsured deposits, as a significant portion of their customers held deposits exceeding the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. This increased their risk during sector volatility. Despite these closures and the following instability, many bank stocks regained stability and ended 2023 with positive returns.

The economic outlook indicates slower growth and the possibility of a rate cut in 2024. This may result in a dip in bank profitability, although it is expected to remain strong, with an anticipated return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11%. Moreover, asset quality is predicted to weaken but should remain manageable, with strong pre-provision earnings providing support.

There are economic risks to consider, including the potential for a recession if the Federal Reserve is not careful enough with rate cuts, as well as the persistent threat of inflation that could result in prolonged high rates. Moreover, credit card charge-offs are anticipated to rise. However, banks with more diversified deposit bases and fewer uninsured deposits are less likely to face high risks as compared to those with more uninsured deposits. Regulatory changes, including the finalization of new capital and resolution requirements, may be implemented in 2024 in response to the banking failures of the previous year.

Despite these challenges, the banking sector is expected to maintain strong profitability and capital buildup, aided by a potentially more favorable rate environment later in the year. Moreover, there are potential investment opportunities in regional banks perceived as undervalued. With this context in mind, let's take a look at the best bank penny stocks to buy now.

"‘New normal’ mortgage rate will be 4.5pc, says Lloyds","The boss of Britain’s biggest lender has said that mortgage rates will stick at a “new normal” of up to 4.5pc.

Charlie Nunn, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group said that after a decade of rates between 1.5pc and 2.5pc, the expectation in the markets was that the Bank Rate would not drop below 3.5pc.

But he said that any cut to the Bank Rate, which is expected later this year, would be “beneficial” and could boost investment into the UK.

It comes after three of the UK’s biggest lenders, HSBC, Barclays and NatWest slashed their mortgage rates ahead of the general election on July 4.

Mr Nunn told Sky News: “There is going to be a higher cost of borrowing in the economy, probably based on what we can see happening at the moment.

“In terms of the impact on the broader consumer in the UK, it’ll take longer to feed through. Around mortgages specifically, we’ve just come off a decade where mortgages have been in the 1.5-2.5pc range.

“The expectations the market have is that interest rates probably won’t get below 3.5pc.

“And that means mortgages, or the new normal for mortgages, will be in that 3.5-4.5pc range, not 1.5-2.5pc.

Mr Nunn said that a reduction in rates would stimulate more government investment, by making borrowing cheaper.

The banking chief added that housing was a “really important topic” and said: “We think you need a 10-year plan to unlock the housing investment that would be needed to really make a difference.”

The average interest for a five-year fixed rate mortgage is currently 5.53pc, according to analyst Moneyfacts. The average offer on a one-year fixed savings account is 4.63pc.

The Bank of England raised the Bank Rate 14 times consecutively beginning in December 2021, before holding rates at 5.25pc last September, where it remained after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting last week.

The latest inflation figures falling to the target of 2pc has raised hopes for a cut as early as August. Analysts suggested that the Bank was unlikely to tinker with rates during an election process, in an effort to protect its perceived independence.

Lloyds, which also owns the Halifax brand, saw a sharp drop of 28pc in pre-tax profits between January and March, having fallen from £2.3bn last year. Rising interest rates had boosted the lender’s profits by almost 50pc.

As the Bank Rate rose, the major lenders cashed in on higher mortgage offerings, and were slapped on the wrist by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and the city regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for failing to also pass on the hikes to savers.

In March, four of the big banks: Santander, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and NatWest, were questioned by the Treasury Select Committee about why rates had taken so long to rise.

Anna Bowes, of comparison website Savings Champion, said: “One of the problems is that the banks don’t need to offer better rates in order to attract cash.”

In its response, the FCA said it “continues to look closely at the value firms provide to their customers.”

Lloyds Bank AGM disrupted by pro-Palestinian and climate protesters,"Luke O'Reilly and Alex Daniel, PA

Lloyds Banking Group’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) has been disrupted by pro-Palestinian and climate activists.

Several protesters stood up one by one to disrupt the meeting at the SEC Armadillo auditorium in Glasgow from the moment it started on Thursday morning.

In a statement, campaign group Tipping Point said they had disrupted the meeting to demand the bank divest from fossil fuel companies and firms “complicit in Israeli genocide and occupation”.

As the incident unfolded, chair of Lloyds Banking Group Sir Robin Budenberg attempted to speak over the protesters, telling the AGM he was “really pleased” to be back in Glasgow.

Sir Robin was forced to stop speaking as the disruption continued.

A female protester could be heard referring to Lloyds “funding genocide in Gaza” and “funding climate catastrophe”.

“Everywhere you look, you can see it happening,” the protester added, referring to “wildfires and floods” before being removed by security guards.

Other attendees shouted: “Oh, shut up” and appeared to want to get involved, with Sir Robin asking them to leave the removal of the protesters to the stewards.

Addressing a male protester shortly after, he said: “Unless you’re prepared to sit down and wait for questions I’m really sorry, but I’m going to have to ask the stewards to remove you.”

Another male protester asked Sir Robin if his “£6 million” salary does not pay for Specsavers glasses, as he cannot see the “atrocities” that are going on.

The demonstrator said: “Do you not see that Lloyds is funding the arms that are destroying people’s futures?

“You are robbing, you are denying people their futures.

“Don’t just focus on the shareholder profits, focus on what makes us human.

“For the love of our children, let’s stop this madness, let’s stop investing in more fossil fuels.”

When the protester appeared to resist attempts by stewards to remove him, Sir Robin said to the room: “It looks like this gentleman does not want to leave.

“You are threatening the safety of other people in this room,” he told the protester."
Activists disrupt Lloyds Bank shareholder meeting,"LONDON (Reuters) -Activists disrupted Lloyds Banking Group's annual shareholder meeting in Glasgow on Thursday, protesting against the bank's alleged provision of financial services to defence firms linked to violence in the Middle East.

Lloyds Chairman Robin Budenberg requested the removal of at least two activists at the outset of the meeting, pleading with the protesters to reserve their questions until later in the proceedings.

""You are profiting from companies who cause harm,"" one protester shouted. ""Focus on humanity, put the human, put the planet before profit,"" they said, as they were escorted from the room.

A spokesperson for the bank said it did not provide financial services directly to companies in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.

Activists have targeted British banks including Barclays' annual shareholder meeting, to protest the lenders' alleged indirect involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and neighbouring territories.

Barclays said it did not invest its own money in companies that supply weapons used by Israel in Gaza, and it only trades shares in such companies on behalf of clients.

Lloyds profits hit by rush of homeowners refinancing mortgages,"Lloyds Bank profits were hit by a rush of homeowners refinancing their mortgages as households sought to take advantage of better rates.

Higher levels of mortgage refinancing between January and March led to more churn in Lloyds’ mortgage book, denting the bank’s profitability.

The bank’s net interest margin (Nim), which measures the difference between what lenders earn on loans and mortgages, and what they pay savers, fell to 2.95pc from 3.22pc last year.

Lloyds’ mortgage book was down £1.8bn in the first quarter overall as customers refinanced their mortgages.

Homeowners hit the pause button when it came to fixing their mortgages at the end of last year owing to economic uncertainty over rates, but moved quickly to take advantage of better deals at the beginning of this year, Lloyds said.

Finance chief William Chalmers said the refinancing “overhang” from the end of 2023 had been expected by the bank.

He said: “This represented customers just pausing in terms of their willingness to re-engage in the mortgage market, and choosing to do so in the first quarter instead.”

The group posted a £1.6bn pre-tax profit in the first quarter, which was about £34m below analyst forecasts and down by 28pc compared with a year earlier. Revenues were £4.5bn

Charlie Nunn, chief executive of Lloyds, is midway through an ambitious four-year turnaround.

Chief Executive Charlie Nunn
Mr Nunn hopes to kickstart growth at the bank with his four year shakeup plan
He is seeking to make Lloyds a slimmer and more profitable bank, cutting costs and boosting sales by offering customers more products such as wealth management services and insurance.

Mr Nunn said: “The group is continuing to deliver in line with expectations in the first quarter of 2024, with solid net income, cost discipline and strong asset quality.”

Lloyds, which owns Halifax, is one of the UK’s largest mortgage providers.

The bank issued an upbeat assessment for the housing market and the UK economy.

Mr Chalmers said mortgage applications were up 20pc versus the same period last year, but expects this to slow during the rest of 2024.

The lender has stuck by its interest rate cut forecasts by the Bank of England, and still predicts three rate cuts this year with the first occurring during the summer.

Lloyds also said it took no further charges related to the potential impact of the motor finance investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

The bank booked a £450m provision related to the possible costs of the redress scheme in February.

The FCA is investigating a number of lenders over historic commissions paid to car dealers linked to the rate of interest charged to borrowers buying a vehicle.

Costs at the bank rose more than expected during the period, mainly because of the impact of a Bank of England levy charged on all banks."
Lloyds profits fall as competition for mortgages heats up,"Lloyds Banking Group has suffered a 28% drop in first-quarter profits amid tough competition for mortgages and savings, but bosses said they expected those pressures to soon ease, helped by an improving UK economy.

The country’s largest mortgage lender, which also owns the Halifax brand, said pre-tax profits dropped to £1.6bn between January and March, having fallen from £2.3bn last year when rising interest rates boosted the lender’s profits by almost 50%.

The bank’s chief financial officer, William Chalmers, said this reflected “keen pricing in the mortgage markets, and savings moving into higher rate accounts”. Competition and jitters in the mortgage market led to a drop in its total outstanding loan book.

It resulted in a 10% drop in net interest income, which accounts for the difference in loan charges versus what is paid out to savers, to £3.2bn in the three months to March.

Pressure from politicians and regulators to pass on interest rates to savers at the same rate they had been raising mortgage and loan charges has squeezed income for major mortgage providers such as Lloyds in recent months.

In response, banks have had to compete harder for customer deposits by offering more substantial returns, particularly on fixed savings products where consumers lock away cash for longer. It attracted £1.3bn in regular customer deposits but that failed to make up for the £3.5bn pulled by business clients.

However, Chalmers said these savings and mortgage pressures were likely to “ease through 2024”, as economic conditions continued to improve.

House prices, which Lloyds previously expected to fall by 2.2% in 2024, are forecast to rise by 1.5% by the end of the year.

The banking group, often seen as a bellwether for the UK economy, is also forecasting a steady improvement in economic growth, at a rate of 0.3% in most quarters and a drop in inflation to 2.4% – from 3.2% in March – resulting in a fall in interest rates to 4.5% by December. It expects the Bank of England to cut rates three times in 2024, starting in the middle of the year.

Chalmers said mortgage applications had already soared by 20% in the first quarter, which could translate into new home loans, and reverse some of its loan book losses. That partly reflected the group’s willingness to offer better interest rates in order to boost lending.

“We’re really pleased to see the pickup in applications, and development of our market share, in that respect. And I think that represents what is a series of competitive offers out there in the market, suiting our customer needs. We’d hope to maintain that ambition over the course of the year,” Chalmers said.

Overall, the banking boss said he expected the UK mortgage market to pick up by 5% by the end of 2024. “We’d hope to play a major part in it,” Chalmers added.

The improved economic outlook meant the bank was more confident that customers could repay their loans. Despite the cost of living crisis and higher mortgage repayments, which have weighed on borrowers, Lloyds set aside £57m for potential defaults, compared with £243m last year.

The Lloyds chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said: “The group is continuing to deliver in line with expectations in the first quarter of 2024, with solid net income, cost discipline and strong asset quality. Our performance provides us with further confidence around our strategic ambitions and 2024 and 2026 guidance.”

Investors had also been hoping for updates on the Financial Conduct Authority investigation into whether consumers have been charged inflated prices for car loans. Lloyds, which has the largest car loan division of the four biggest UK banks, has already put aside £450m – far short of the £2bn that analysts believe it could be on the hook for.

However, Lloyds did not give any more details about whether it might put aside more cash to cover potential fines or compensation for customers. The FCA has indicated that it will give more details on its findings by the autumn."
Lloyds profit falls 28% as competition in mortgage market steps up,"Lloyds Banking Group has seen its profits drop by more than a quarter in recent months, as interest rates reached a peak and competition in the mortgage and savings market heated up.

But the UK’s biggest mortgage lender said its customers are “resilient” as it unveiled improved predictions for parts of the economy this year.

Lloyds said its statutory pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year hit £1.6 billion, down 28% from the £2.3 billion reported during the same period last year.

It came in slightly below forecasts, with analysts expecting a quarterly profit of £1.7 billion.


Lloyds said the decline was partially driven by lower net interest income – the difference between what it generates from loans and pays out for deposits – which was down a 10th to £3.2 billion.

This had been expected as mortgage costs eased from the highs reached during the start of last year and as more savers moved cash into accounts with higher returns.

Total lending by the banking group, which also includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland, was down £1.2 billion during the quarter.

This was driven by lower mortgage lending, as more homeowners chose to refinance their mortgage deal at the start of the year than at the end of 2024 when there was more economic uncertainty.

It came as competition has stepped up among UK lenders to offer customers better deals amid a period of historically high rates.

But, since the end of the quarter, Lloyds has seen an increase in the volume of mortgage applications, which it expects to result in greater lending through the year.

Chief financial officer William Chalmers said about half of the group’s customers tied to a fixed-rate mortgage have refinanced since October 2022, representing about £100 billion worth of lending.

A “significant chunk” of borrowers, with loans worth about £50 billion, are set to still refinance over the course of the year.

Meanwhile, total deposits were down by £2.2 billion during the quarter, which it said reflected more business customers withdrawing cash.

Mr Chalmers said: “We have seen an improved outlook for the economy – we think it will get better over the course of 2024 versus what we saw at the year end.”

“Not massively so,” he stressed, but added: “Overall I think that is positive from a customer activity point of view.”


Credit card spending is up around 7% year on year, which Mr Chalmers said reflects a “relatively resilient” consumer.

According to new projections provided by the bank, average house prices across the UK are expected to rise by 1.5% this year, with Lloyds previously forecasting a 2.2% fall.

It is also expecting interest rates to be cut three times this year, with the first 0.25 percentage point reduction coming in May or June.

The group’s chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said the quarterly results “provides us with further confidence around our strategic ambitions and 2024 to 2026 guidance”, and that the bank is “continuing to support customers”."
Lloyds profit drops against bumper 2023 as margins shrink,"Lloyds Banking Group has posted a 28 per cent fall in profit – in line with analysts’ estimates – as price wars and the prospect of interest rate cuts forced it to offer better rates to customers.

The group – which owns Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows – reported a pretax profit of £1.63bn for the first three months of 2024.

This figure is down from £1.78bn during the previous quarter and 28 per cent lower than the £2.26bn in the first quarter of 2023. A company-complied analyst consensus had expected a profit of £1.66bn.

Lloyds’ profits were propelled to a record high last year following interest rate hikes from the Bank of England. However, its margins have narrowed into 2024 amid intense competition for mortgages and deposits, and the expectation that rate-setters will make multiple cuts this year.

The lender’s net interest income – the gap between what it earns from interest on loans and pays out to savers – fell to £3.05bn in the first quarter from £3.43bn at the end of last year.

Meanwhile, its net interest margin (NIM) fell to 2.95 per cent in the first quarter, from 3.22 per cent in the same period last year. Analysts had expected a margin of 2.93 per cent.

In recent weeks, concern over the US economy and stickier-than-expected UK inflation has caused traders to pare their bets on rate cuts from the Bank of England. Markets are currently pricing in just two cuts, down from seven at the start of the year.

As a result, lenders could see another boost from higher-for-longer rates this year. Lloyds has reaffirmed its guidance of a NIM of greater than 2.9 per cent for 2024. It continues to expect three base rate cuts from the central bank this year, with finance chief William Chalmers telling reporters that the lender expected the first cut “sometime around the middle of the year”.

As Britain’s largest domestically-focused bank, Lloyds is considered a bellwether for the UK economy. The group’s credit impairment charge came in at £56m, down from £242m in the previous quarter and £541m this time last year, suggesting resilience among its customer base despite the tough economic backdrop.

Loans and advances to customers fell during the quarter to £448.5bn from £452.3bn in the previous three months, with a £1.6bn reduction in Lloyds’ UK mortgages portfolio. Lending to small and medium-sized firms also fell by £0.8bn.

On the other side of its balance sheet, deposits fell £2.2bn during the quarter to £469.2bn. The decline was driven by a £3.5bn fall in commercial banking deposits, partly offset by retail deposits rising by £1.3bn.

“The group is continuing to deliver in line with expectations,” said chief executive Charlie Nunn. “This underpins our ambition of higher, more sustainable returns.”

Lloyds announced in February that it took a £450m provision to cover potential costs tied to a review by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into now-banned commission arrangements on car loans that analysts say could cost the motor finance industry up to £16bn in compensation payouts.

The bank said on Wednesday that it had made no further changes relating to the potential impact of the probe, noting that the FCA is due to set out its next steps in September.

Questions loom over whether Lloyds might raise its provision to align more closely with analysts’ estimates. Lloyds, which owns the UK’s largest auto lender Black Horse, is considered the most exposed UK bank in absolute terms. Analysts at RBC estimate it could take a hit of around £2.5bn, or up to £3.5bn in its worst-case scenario, from potential compensation fees.

Earlier this month, the FCA wrote to motor finance firms to remind them to “maintain adequate financial resources at all times”.

“From our perspective, we feel that we comply with all the applicable regulations,” Chalmers said. “We do look forward to an impartial review that will give us some clarity in terms of the step forward in this area and in a way that, I think the FCA wants to achieve, results in an orderly outcome for what is a vital industry.”

Lloyds saw operating costs of £2.4bn last quarter, up 11 per cent year-on-year. It said the increase was mainly driven by a new sector-wide levy from the Bank of England and a £100m rise in severance charges taken early in the year.

The bank’s shares fell as much as 3.2 per cent on Wednesday morning.

Benjamin Toms, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “In our view Lloyds’ stronger deposit franchise should help the bank keep NIM relatively stable when compared with peers. Additionally, Lloyds has invested heavily in its other income line which should allow the bank to keep top-line momentum once the benefit from higher rates fades.”"
Lloyds quarterly profit drops 28% from bumper 2023 earnings,"Lloyds Banking Group has seen its profits drop by more than a quarter in recent months, following a bumper 2023 which saw its earnings hit record highs.

The lender said its statutory pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year hit £1.6 billion, down 28% from the £2.3 billion reported during the same period last year.

It came in slightly below forecasts with analysts expecting a quarterly profit of £1.7 billion.

Lloyds said the decline was partially driven by lower net interest income – meaning the difference between what it generates from loans and pays out for deposits – which was down a 10th to £3.2 billion.

This was expected as mortgage costs eased from the highs hit during the start of last year and as more savers moved cash into accounts with higher returns.

The group’s chief executive Charlie Nunn said the quarterly results “provides us with further confidence around our strategic ambitions and 2024 to 2026 guidance”, and assured the bank was “continuing to support customers”.

Meanwhile, new projections provided by the bank point to an improved economic outlook.

Average house prices across the UK are expected to rise by 1.5% this year, with Lloyds previously forecasting a 2.2% fall.

It also expects the UK’s unemployment rate to average at 4.3% over 2024."
The British community abandoned by banks – where it costs £240 to visit a branch,"Almost two banks close in Britain every day. Since January 2015, 5,934 branches have shut, according to consumer group Which? – at a rate of 54 per month. If the closures continue at the same pace, we will be left bankless within a decade.

There is one part of Britain which is already living in this dystopia.

Robert Francis is standing outside the derelict and deserted Lloyds Bank building in Hugh Street, St Mary’s – the largest of five inhabited islands which make up the Isles of Scilly.

Lloyds shut its doors for good almost two years ago to the day, leaving Scilly without a bank for the first time in at least 70 years.

Rust now streaks across the walls of the 19th century Grade I-listed building. The paint is peeling on the once-grand pillars at its entrance and, last month, the building had to be cordoned off after slate tiles from the roof came loose and threatened to rain down on passersby.

Local politician Francis, who is chairman of the Council of the Isles of Scilly, is seething. “It’s a blot on our public realm,” he says. “We are trying to make the place look lovely and they are an absolute eyesore. They left it in a disgusting state.”

It’s not just Lloyds that has upped sticks. A few hundred yards away lies the empty Barclays building, the first of the two banks to abandon the isolated community when it closed in 2018.

A £240 journey to visit the bank
If any of the 2,100 islanders want to visit their bank in person, they need to cross the sea. They can do this either by flying to Land’s End airport and then relying on an infrequent bus to take them to Penzance or, in the summer months, they can take a direct ferry.

However, because of the timings of the ferry, islanders have to pay for a night’s accommodation in Penzance before getting the next one back the following morning.

If an islander wanted to visit their nearest bank next Monday, even for just a 30-minute appointment, it would take almost eight-and-a-half hours and cost at least £142.

The journey begins at St Mary’s airport at 7.50am, one hour before departure on the 17-seater plane to Land’s End. Despite landing at 9.10am, there’s no bus for another 73 minutes. One hour, three minutes and two bus transfers later, they would arrive in Penzance at 11.26am. Even if they left the bank by midday, there’s no bus back to the airport until 1pm, meaning they’d be back at the airport for 2pm, before an almost two hour wait for the flight, which lands back in Scilly at 4.15pm.

This all assumes there are no delays, which is a common occurrence. Transport to the islands is disrupted up to a third of the year, with poor visibility often delaying flights and high winds cancelling ferries.

Due to limited ferry times, islanders visiting their local bank have to pay for a night's accommodation in Penzance - Dale Cherry
Lloyds and Barclays have both defended their closures, pointing to a dwindling customer base which used the branches and the increasing number of people using online and mobile banking.

Lloyds said 71pc of islanders used other ways to do their personal banking and branch transactions fell by 47pc between 2016 and 2020. Barclays said 73pc of its Scilly customers were using alternative methods to bank, and that nationally 98pc of customer interactions are now carried out digitally.

There is no community banking hub in Scilly, and residents can only go to the Post Office for simple tasks such as depositing money. Both Barclays and Lloyds sent representatives to the islands for a short period after closing their banks, but difficulty finding staff and making the journey meant both have since stopped.

Avril Mumford, an 82-year-old resident, says: “Going to the Post Office is just not the same as going to the bank. I’m not asking for a bank manager, but even if they just had a representative here to help people. Even if it was just once a month, it would be something.”

But while simple tasks such as checking your bank balance have become easier by the advent of mobile banking, often when islanders need to visit their bank, it is because they have no other option. Scilly has a disproportionately high number of small business owners and unlike personal banking, tasks often need to be carried out in-person.

Frances Grottick, who is vice-chairman of the Council, recently paid close to £200 to visit the mainland and visit her bank. “I wanted to add somebody as a signatory onto an account…you can’t do that online, you have to attend in person which means going to Penzance or for some islanders as far as Truro which is obviously a considerable expense.”

Joe Babcock paid even more money – it cost him £240 in airfares to get to his local bank. “That’s money you don’t really need to spend,” he says. Babcock, who owns Guiding Star, a passenger boat which ferries tourists between the different islands, recently had to travel to Penzance to change his business address.

“We can go to the Post Office to deposit money, and some of our business has gone online anyway, but I had to go on a special trip to change my business address. You couldn’t do that online in the same way that you could do with a personal bank,” Babcock says.

Tim Guthrie spent weeks dealing with Lloyds over the phone in the summer of 2022 after receiving an unexpected letter saying that his two business accounts were to be shut down.

He manages almost 60 different holiday lets for owners and used his two accounts to hold the funds before they were paid out to owners after the guest had completed their stay. While his accounts were still eventually closed, he believes the issue could have been dealt with had the bank manager still been in place.

He has since had to set up 56 bank accounts, one for each property, to resolve the problem; otherwise, he says he would have had to close his business, making eight members of staff redundant.

Guthrie, who has been banking with Lloyds for almost 50 years, says: “Eighteen months I’ve been doing that. It’s absolutely bonkers but the amount of work and the amount of grief, it’s shortened my life by god knows how long, my blood pressure was through the ceiling.”

‘There is a big social implication to this’
Guthrie’s anger is that despite no longer being able to see his local branch manager or having any local representative from the bank who understands his business, he is still paying Lloyds the same amount for his business accounts.

Council chairman Robert Francis, who owns the Star Castle Hotel, in St Mary’s agrees with Guthrie.

“I know people call it progress but it’s not progress really. It might suit the banks to operate in this kind of way, but it certainly does not suit the end consumer.”

Tim Guthrie

Both banks appear in rude health, Barclays had a pre-tax profit of £6.6bn last year, while Lloyds stood at £7.5bn. The most recent figures for the Isles of Scilly show the GDP was just £63m in 2021.

Francis says: “If you are running a business over here like we are, we are obviously taking a lot more money in our main season and the winter costs us a lot of money but you can’t pick and choose. It seems to me Lloyds is picking and choosing.

“At the end of the day they’ve got to say this is where we make our money, however in order to run a bank that is actually going to work for its customers and not just work for commercial purposes, we have to take a hit with these other expenses.

“We’ve got an ageing population here as well. Some of them are pretty savvy [with online banking], some of them don’t want to go anywhere near it and yet they still need financial guidance and help.

“They need to understand their retirement and have discussions about their money and what they can do. If you can’t get on the internet and you can’t get any local support, it’s very difficult for them and their mental health to sort it out.

“You’ve got to have family or other people who can do it for them and not everybody has that. Some people are living alone, some people just don’t have the support. There is a big social implication to this.”

The population of Scilly fell by 6.8pc between 2021 and 2011, according to census data, despite the South West as a region increasing by 7.8pc. Between the two censuses, the average age of islanders increased by four years from 46 to 50, and more than a quarter of the population are now retired.

After almost 40 years running Scilly’s oldest newsagents, Mumford is about to join them and take her well-earned retirement.

Last month, her husband Clive died. Rather than visiting her local Lloyds branch, a bank she joined at the age of four, she was left having to speak to call centres to help close her husband’s accounts.

“Normally you could pop into the bank and do it there but I had to do it by telephone and you have to wait quite a long time before you get through. In the past, you could have gone into the bank and had it explained to you because I didn’t know what the procedure was.”

She adds: “I can do banking online but there are some elderly people who can’t, they wouldn’t know where to start. I run a corner shop and people like to have a chat, they like to talk to somebody, they don’t really want to do it all online.”

‘It hit home how vulnerable we are’
Back in the Council chambers, vice-chairman Grottick recalls how Lloyds broke the news to the local politicians it was closing Scilly’s last remaining bank in 2022.

“They set up a Microsoft Teams meeting when they realised they were going to take away our last bank.

“We sat there and four people with very long titles sat around a table and one of them was the ‘customer facilitation relationship manager’ and she said ‘What can we do to help?’, I replied: ‘Don’t close the bank.’

“The conversation got a bit stilted because it seemed only at that point did they realise what they were doing to a small isolated community.”

Famed for its pristine beaches and turquoise waters loved by thousands of holidaymakers each summer, the locals are crying out for help to make sure Scilly remains a viable place to live all year round.

Grottick says: “We aren’t looking for handouts, we want to look after ourselves, but we need help and something like the loss of our last bank [hit] home just how vulnerable we are and just how much support we need.”

Francis says: “I may be short-sighted but I don’t think so, I’ve been in business all my life. I know from my hotel business how much value there is in word of mouth and goodwill. Nearly all our guests return and they tell everyone else, and that is the backbone of our business  – and it can’t be much different with a bank.”

He adds: “If there was serious goodwill generated by a bank, they would actually benefit from that far more than they are possibly imagining.”

A spokesman for Lloyds Bank said: “We made the decision to close our St Mary’s branch in 2022 as customers were choosing to bank in different ways and using the branch less often. The local Post Office on Hugh Street offers everyday banking, customers can also manage their money online, through our mobile app or by calling us.”

A Barclays spokesman said: “As visits to branches continue to fall and customers increasingly bank online, we need to adapt to provide the best service for all our customers. In 2018, the majority of our branch customers in the Isles of Scilly used alternative methods to bank, which led to a decline in branch use prior to closure.

“Where levels of demand don’t support a branch, customers can use our digital services be it online or via the Barclays app. We also support access to cash with our cashback without purchase service, 24-hour deposit-taking ATMs and by working alongside the Post Office and Cash Access UK.”"
Those who invested in Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) three years ago are up 41%,"one simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON:LLOY), which is up 22%, over three years, soundly beating the market decline of 0.5% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 10% , including dividends .

So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.

View our latest analysis for Lloyds Banking Group

To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During three years of share price growth, Lloyds Banking Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 85% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 6.52.

The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free interactive report on Lloyds Banking Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.

What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Lloyds Banking Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 41%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

A Different Perspective
It's good to see that Lloyds Banking Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 10% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 0.7% per year over five years. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

"Insurers impose 'tax on being poor' through monthly price hike, says Which?","Consumer group Which? has called on the UK's financial regulator to clamp down on insurance companies hiking the price of monthly payments, referring to the levy as a ""tax on being poor.""

Which? asked 39 car insurers and 34 home insurers what annual percentage rates (APRs) were being applied to monthly payments and where there was more than one rate, what made the difference.

Some car owners are charged APRs of nearly 40% when paying for insurance monthly, while people who stump up the yearly sum get off lightly.

Home insurance is only slightly better, Which? found, with some companies imposing charges of almost 35% APR on monthly instalments.

Car insurers: the best deals and worst offenders
For car insurers, the highest rate was 1st Central’s 39.11%. It charges between 5% and 39.11%, giving each customer a personal interest rate after a credit risk assessment.

The average rate across 27 providers that charge interest and disclosed their rate was 23.37%.

Read more: When will interest rates fall and what should you do?

Only two (5%) of the car insurers asked — NFU Mutual and Hiscox (HSX.L) — said they do not charge interest on monthly repayments.

Some 10 firms refused to disclose this information when asked, including AXA (CS.PA), Budget, Dial Direct, Esure, First Alternative, Geoffrey Insurance, Nutshell, Sheilas’ Wheels, Swiftcover and Zenith.

Markerstudy, which provides insurance under the Bradford & Bingley, Budget, Dial Direct, Zenith, Geoffrey Insurance and Nutshell brands, told Which? it performs “regular assessments (at least annual) on the rates of credit we offer our customers” and it is “confident that we have the appropriate governance, oversight and controls in place to ensure our premium finance provides fair value and delivers appropriate customer outcomes.”

A spokesperson for Axa said: “We believe that using representative APR provides an inaccurate comparison of the interest rates insurance companies charge to customers for paying monthly. This is because firms calculate representative APR in different ways.”

Home insurers: who's leading the pack?
For home insurance, the highest rate was charged by Co-op Insurance — where customers pay between 31.31% to 34.75% APR on monthly payments. The average among providers that charged a rate and disclosed it was 23%.

Read more: The UK’s most expensive streets ranked

Co-op Insurance told Which? that it “welcomes” the findings, noting the “importance” of “giving customers the option to spread the cost of their insurance over the course of a year.”

After benchmarking its rates, the company said: “We are looking to reduce them; we will update our customers on this as soon as we can.”

Fifteen (44%) of the home insurance providers surveyed said they do not charge interest — Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Hiscox, HSBC (HSBA.L), Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L), MBNA, M&S Bank (MKS.L), Nationwide Building Society (NBS.L), NFU Mutual, Sagic, Sainsbury’s Bank (SBRY.L), Santander (BNC.L), TSB, Urban Jungle and Yorkshire Building Society.

Seven providers refused to disclose their rates, including AXA, Bradford & Bingley, Budget, Dial Direct, Esure, Sheilas’ Wheels and Swiftcover.

The higher rates charged by insurers to pay for cover monthly resemble interest applicable for credit card borrowing.

A call for better regulation
The research follows previous Which? investigations that found that those who pay for cover in monthly instalments can end up paying hundreds of pounds more over the course of a year due to interest on payments.

Quotes called in in November for a real 18-year-old driver on First Central’s Premier Online policy (costing £3,388 to buy upfront), came with an interest rate of 36.32% APR to pay monthly — adding a further £504.

“We understand it is important to customers that we keep the price of insurance as low as possible — and benchmarking tells us that we are competitive for both annual premiums and for those that wish to pay monthly through a credit arrangement,"" First Central told Which?.

In January of this year, the average credit card rate was 34.8% with the majority of cards charging up to 25%, compared to the average car insurance premium finance rate of 23% and the highest rate of 39%. The risk to insurers, however, is much lower because the credit being offered is directly linked to the sale of the insurance policy and non-payment by customers can lead to the cancellation of the policy.

The consumer group is now calling on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to get a grip on firms charging high amounts of interest on monthly repayments, which can penalise customers who are less able to pay for their cover in a one-off lump sum.

“The regulator has been clear — paying for insurance monthly is a tax on being poor and it’s shocking to see providers still trying to justify the practice,"" said Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy. ""Given many firms’ interest rates don’t seem to reflect the modest risk they’re taking on, customers paying monthly are being charged disproportionately more than those paying annually.""

“It is now time for the FCA to step up and to get tough with firms that take advantage of customers who can least afford it.”"
"Taylor Swift fans targeted by surge in concert ticket scams, major bank warns","More than £1 million could already have been lost in the UK to fraudsters pretending to offer Taylor Swift concert tickets, a major bank estimates.

Lloyds Bank has issued a warning to fans, saying that more than 600 Lloyds Banking Group customers have come forward so far to report being scammed.

The figures were based on analysis of relevant purchase scams reported by customers of Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland, where Swift and/or the Eras Tour were referenced as part of the claim, between July 2023 and March 2024.

The average amount lost by each victim was £332, though in some cases the loss was more than £1,000, Lloyds said.

As the figures are based solely on Lloyds Bank’s own customer data, it estimates that, across the UK, there are likely to have been at least 3,000 victims since tickets went on sale, with more than £1 million being lost to fraudsters so far.

The calculation is based on Lloyd Banking Group’s current account market share and assumes similar trends across customers of other UK banks.

Fans aged 25 to 34 who are trying to get their hands on sold-out tickets are most likely to be targeted, with many scams originating on social media, Lloyds warned.

Looking more broadly at concert ticket scams, fans of major artists such as Coldplay, Beyonce and Harry Styles were among those targeted last summer, Lloyds said.

Across all concert ticket scams, victims were losing £133 on average.

Purchase scams can happen when someone is tricked into sending money via bank transfer to buy goods or services that are fake, shoddy, or do not exist.

Ticket scams often involve fake adverts, posts or listings on social media, often offering tickets or access to events which have already sold out.

Victims are asked to pay up-front for the tickets, but once the payment is made the scammers disappear. This leaves the buyer without the tickets and out of pocket.

When tickets for an event are scarce, fraudsters know they can cash in on eager fans willing to pay much more, by falsely claiming to have tickets for sale.

There are often two waves of fraud – the first when tickets go on sale and the second around the time an event takes place – Lloyds said.

Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director, Lloyds Bank, said: “For her legion of dedicated Swifties, the excitement is building ahead of Taylor’s Eras Tour finally touching down in the UK this summer.

“However cruel fraudsters have wasted no time in targeting her most loyal fans as they rush to pick up tickets for her must-see concerts.

“It’s easy to let our emotions get the better of us when we find out our favourite artist is going to be performing live, but it’s important not to let those feelings cloud our judgment when trying to get hold of tickets.”

Lisa Webb, consumer law expert at Which?, said: “We’ve heard from disappointed Swifties who have bought tickets on social media, only to realise it’s a scam when their promised tickets never materialise. Unfortunately, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

“Don’t be tempted to buy tickets from anyone other than authorised sellers, as your rights can be significantly reduced if something goes wrong. If you are buying tickets, we recommend you pay using your credit card if the tickets cost more than £100, or by PayPal, as both these methods may provide protection if something goes wrong.

“If you think you have fallen victim to a ticket scam, contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud or Police Scotland.”

Here are some general tips from Lloyds Bank to stay safe when buying concert tickets:

1. Buy from trusted retailers

Only purchase tickets from well-known, official ticket platforms.

Be cautious on social media – remember it is easy for fraudsters to create fake ads including pictures of real tickets.

2. Avoid deals that look too good to be true

Tickets for sale at low prices or for sold-out events should ring alarm bells. Ask yourself if the deal seems realistic.

3. Consider paying by debit or credit card

This helps to protect your money should something go wrong. PayPal is another option that gives people added protections if something goes wrong."
Telegraph faces financial stability threat from Barclay family,"The Telegraph would be at risk of financial instability if the Barclay family were to regain control in the wake of the failed takeover backed by the United Arab Emirates, it can be revealed.

Suspicious transactions discovered while the company was placed in receivership by Lloyds Banking Group last year mean that its access to finance could be restricted by the family’s potential comeback.

A loan of £60m from Lloyds to the parent company of The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine, Press Acquisitions Limited, would be threatened with a demand for immediate repayment, sources said.

The borrowing is a normal corporate loan unrelated to the £1.2bn overdue Barclay family debt that prompted the bank to send in receivers. It has never been in default.

It is understood that Lloyds was among the parties involved in The Telegraph’s receivership that made Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to the National Crime Agency, which acts as a clearing house and can forward intelligence to authorities including the Serious Fraud Office and HMRC.

The SARs, which have been previously reported, were also made by the independent directors who are still overseeing the company, as well as legal and restructuring advisers, according to multiple sources.

The concerns were triggered by the movement of large sums between The Telegraph and other companies controlled by the Barclay family. The independent directors subsequently called in the specialist law firm BCL to investigate alongside the annual audit of the accounts, conducted by PwC.

Lloyds’ knowledge of the suspicious transactions means it could withdraw financing if the Barclays were to regain control, under its own regulatory obligations and integrity policies.

The family, who have experienced personal and business turmoil in recent years, regained beneficial ownership of The Telegraph in December after paying off their £1.2bn debt to Lloyds with new loans mostly provided by the UAE. As part of the complex deal, RedBird IMI, a US fund majority backed by the Gulf power, acquired an option to take ownership of The Telegraph and The Spectator.

The plan was derailed last month when cross-party action in the House of Lords prompted the Government to outlaw foreign state ownership of UK newspapers in legislation expected to come into force around the end of this month.

Since they regained ownership, the Barclay family have been barred from controlling The Telegraph by measures put in place by the Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to allow regulatory scrutiny of RedBird IMI’s plans. She kept in place the independent directors, who were originally appointed by Lloyds as part of the receivership.

RedBird IMI is preparing to attempt an onward sale of the option to own The Telegraph, but the process is fraught with complications including the uncertain roles of the Barclay family, the Government and the independent directors in the process. The restrictions that prevent the Barclay family exercising control are on track to fall away as soon as RedBird IMI gives formal notification that it does not intend to pursue a takeover.

The Barclay family declined to comment on the prospect of regaining control or any action that Lloyds might take in response. A spokesman previously said: “The accounts, including to the year ended 31 December 2022, have been fully audited and signed off by PwC.”

Lloyds declined to comment on its loan to Press Acquisitions Limited or SARs linked to The Telegraph."

Lloyds cuts risk management roles in bid to ‘move at greater pace’,"Lloyds is cutting risk management jobs after concluding that its overly cautious approach is holding back growth.

Roles are to be cut after a review conducted by the bank concluded that internal risk structures were acting as a “blocker” to change.

Chief executive Charlie Nunn is seeking to overhaul Lloyds by cutting costs and driving up sales as the environment becomes harder for UK banks this year.

However, a survey of staff which was first reported by the Financial Times found that two-thirds of senior executives said the way Lloyds assessed risks was holding back Mr Nunn’s shake-up plan.

A poll of all staff also found that less than 50pc thought “intelligent risk-taking” was encouraged at the bank.

Lloyds operates a self-described “three lines of defence” risk model, where three separate layers of management review non-financial risks such as compliance with regulation.

Managers on the ground have primary responsibility for this, with extra oversight provided by two departments above them, the risk division and Group Internal Audit.

The shake-up will see 45 jobs removed from these risk teams, equivalent to around 1.5pc of the 3,600 people who work in risk jobs for Lloyds.

The job losses are the result of a wider reshuffle within Lloyds’ risk function and other parts of the business announced in March. In total about 175 roles will be axed.

This will be offset by the creation of 130 new roles focused on specialist risk management, leaving 45 fewer jobs overall.

The changes will help the bank in “resetting our approach to risk and controls” and enable Lloyds to “move at greater pace”, according to an internal memo seen by the Financial Times.

Mr Nunn has been ramping up the pace of change at the bank after setting out a turnaround plan in February 2022.

He hopes to kickstart growth by focusing on wealth management and insurance products for the mass affluent alongside core banking and saving products.

Mr Nunn is also seeking to improve profits by trimming costs. As part of the overhaul, thousands of middle-management jobs were put at risk of redundancy last year.

Like other banks, Lloyds expects to face more challenging conditions in the year ahead with the expectation that interest rates will soon begin falling. This will lead to lower levels of net interest income, the big driver of Lloyds’ profits.

Lloyds is the UK’s most valuable domestic bank, and the largest mortgage lender in the country thanks to its Halifax brand.

A Lloyds spokesman said: “Making changes means not only creating new roles and upskilling colleagues in some parts of the business, but also having to say goodbye to talented colleagues who have been a part of the group’s success in the past.

“Where that is unfortunately the case, we will do everything we can to support them with the changes recently announced. In this case, there are around 45 role reductions, after new roles being created are factored in.”"
Lloyds to cut jobs in risk management after finding it was a ‘blocker’ to transformation progress,"Lloyds Banking Group is preparing to axe roles in its risk management division after finding that it was a “blocker” to the company’s transformation strategy, City A.M. understands.

The group’s chief risk officer Stephen Shelley said in a memo last month that it was “resetting our approach to risk and controls” following an internal review.

Shelley noted that two-thirds of Lloyds’ executives thought risk management was impeding progress, while less than half of its workforce believed “intelligent risk-taking” was encouraged.

He said Lloyds’ “initial focus is on non-financial risks” and a new model would allow it to “move at greater pace” on its group strategy.

“We know people are frustrated by time-consuming processes and ingrained ways of working that impede our ability to be competitive and leave us lagging behind our peers,” Shelley added.

The Financial Times first reported the news.

A person familiar with the matter told City A.M. that the restructuring would see around 175 permanent roles at risk of redundancy, including 153 in the risk unit.

However, the person added that the lender expected to create 130 vacancies focused on specialist risk and technical expertise. Some 3,600 people currently work in Lloyds’ risk division.

Mark Brown, general secretary of independent employee union BTU, told the FT that Lloyds appeared to be “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” and that loosening its risk controls “could potentially have catastrophic consequences for the future of the bank”.

The news comes as Lloyds faces potential compensation costs tied to the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) review into now-banned motor finance commission arrangements.

Analysts have said the probe could cost the auto lending sector as much as £16bn, while RBC has estimated that Lloyds could face the biggest hit of any bank at up to £3.5bn. Lloyds in February made a £450m provision to cover potential costs tied to the FCA’s review.

A Lloyds spokesperson told City A.M. on Wednesday: “Making changes means not only creating new roles and upskilling colleagues in some parts of the business but also having to say goodbye to talented colleagues who have been a part of the group’s success in the past.

“Where that is unfortunately the case, we will do everything we can to support them with the changes recently announced. In this case, there are around 45 role reductions, after new roles being created are factored in.”

Lloyds, which has around 60,000 total employees, launched a plan in February 2022 to invest £4bn over the next five years to diversify away from interest rate-sensitive income streams like mortgages and become a “digital leader”.

As part of its shift towards online services, the lender confirmed in January that it would cut around 1,600 jobs across its branch network and create 830 new roles in a “relationship growth” team."
Barclays launches challenge against car finance mis-selling claim,"Barclays has launched a legal challenge over a ruling that it unfairly paid commission to a car finance broker.

Thousands of drivers could be entitled to payments over fear that motorists paid billions of pounds more than necessary to dealers and brokers for mis-sold car finance.

Consumer experts have said the total compensation bill could be similar to the PPI scandal.

In around 40pc of cases, regulator Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found the interest rate on car finance deals was at the whim of the dealership. Between 80pc and 90pc of new cars have been bought using car finance in recent years, including personal contract purchase (PCP) and hire purchase.

The case of Miss L, was highlighted by the FCA alongside one other involving Lloyds Banking Group, when it announced a probe into mis-selling in January.

She was not aware that the loan agreement involved a £1,600 commission to be paid by Barclays Partner Finance to a credit broker when she took out a loan to buy a car in 2018, the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) found.

The second landmark case, which paved the way for thousands of new claims to be heard going back to 2007, was against Black Horse, a subsection of Lloyds Banking Group, and heard that Mrs Y, who took out a hire purchase agreement, was charged 5.5pc interest, but could have paid just 2.49pc.

A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman confirmed to the Telegraph that it is reviewing its own case against the FOS.

Car dealers, who act as brokers for lenders, were pressured to apply higher rates to drivers in return for larger commission payments, it is alleged.

The so-called discretionary commission arrangements were banned by the city regulator in 2021, and in January it announced that it would launch a probe into commission arrangements dating back to 2007.

While the regulator did not name and shame the individual firms it would be examining, it did engage leading accountancy firm EY to carry out what is known as a “skilled person’s review” into the problem. A decision on whether to approve mass payouts is due in September.


It comes after Lloyds Banking Group put aside £450m for potential compensation arising from the FCA’s probe into interest-linked commission payments in its annual results in February, as concerns grow about payouts.

The motor finance industry could be on the hook for as much as £16bn as a result of the scandal, investment bank RBC analysis suggested.

Consumer champion Martin Lewis has said that motorists could be entitled to one of the largest payouts in UK history, after more than one million complaints have been submitted through an online tool on his MoneySavingExpert.com website.

He said: “In value terms, car finance mis-selling is potentially going to be the second biggest reclaim payout in UK history – possibly over £10bn repaid – which could even provide a fillip to the economy as PPI did.”

A Barclays spokesman said that it did not agree with the FOS decision in the case in question, and therefore the bank was challenging it.

But they continued: “This challenge relates to a single, specific case and we continue to support the FCA’s review into historic motor financing arrangements.

“Due to the ongoing nature of this case, we cannot share anything further at this time.”

A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman said: “We are currently reviewing the recent FOS decision and will support the FCA with its industry review.”

A spokesman for the Financial Ombudsman Service said: “When people take out a car loan it’s imperative they are treated fairly and the financial implications are totally transparent.

“We recently resolved two complaints where we found that the way the commission arrangement between the lender and the car dealer worked was unfair on the consumer. These types of discretionary commission arrangements were banned by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2021.”

The spokesman continued: “It’s disappointing that we’ve now received a legal challenge on one of these decisions. In the meantime, it is essential that firms continue to investigate and respond to other complaints promptly, whilst complying with their regulatory obligations.”"
Lloyds left me in limbo in a water-damaged mouldy home,"I came home one evening to find water pouring under the kitchen door. The tank in the attic had overflowed after the ballcock valve broke and brought down part of the kitchen ceiling. My insurer, Lloyds, speedily dispatched a surveyor and a drying company, but two months later nothing further has happened. The drying company won’t install dehumidifiers until the rest of the soaked ceiling is safely removed and this hasn’t been done because Lloyds has not yet approved the repair costs quoted by its contractor. Meanwhile I am living in a wet and increasingly mouldy house and more cracks are appearing in the ceiling.
LA, Hereford

You are in your seventies and the health implications of two months in a sodden house are serious. As are the consequences for the rest of the property as the damp and mould spread. Your bedroom and bathroom were also affected. It’s shocking Lloyds did not authorise removal of the ceiling so drying work could start while it pondered the repair quote. It’s also shocking you were not offered alternative accommodation. Lloyds admitted that it had let you down and offered a paltry £200 for the “inconvenience”. It was another three weeks before the ceiling was removed, and the repairs were finally completed five months after that.

Same old problems at ‘transformed’ insurer Esure
Most companies compete to attract more customers. Not the insurer Esure, which informed one policyholder that, due to a system upgrade, it was dumping him. He was lucky. Other customers suspect they too have been dumped while still being owed large sums in unpaid claims. This upgrade of Esure’s aims, it proclaims smugly and ambiguously, is part of “fixing insurance for good”.

“Claims are often referred to as the moment of truth in insurance,” according to its vision statement, “so in early 2022, Esure embarked on a journey to revolutionise [its] claims and fraud transformation.”

What does this revolution look like? VG of Bristol tried to make a claim on her home insurance policy after a water pipe burst. She was unable to log in to her account and spent an hour on hold on its phone line. It turned out her policy renewal four months earlier had been lost during the system upgrade, although her £477 premium had been taken. She was offered a refund and invited to take out a new policy, which meant she would not be covered for her claim. Esure then offered an indemnity certificate. It would pocket the premium, issue an indemnity certificate to cover the claim, then require her to buy a new 12-month policy, leaving her hundreds of pounds out of pocket. She asked if a new policy could be created and backdated. Not possible, said Esure. VG ended up paying for the repair herself.

Meanwhile, AL of Merthyr Tydfil was involved in a no-fault accident. Esure declared his car a writeoff in February last year, but the finance company that provided the funding for hire purchase has yet to receive the settlement money. AL is therefore having to continue to make payments for a car he no longer has.

Esure blamed “human error” for both botched claims. VG has been refunded £477 for the nonexistent policy and for the repair costs and given £125 in goodwill. The company claimed that the settlement sum for AL’s car was paid to the finance firm a year ago, but returned “some months later” and, due to an oversight, not reissued. It’s now been remitted and AL has received £250 in compensation."
Scam warning as UK banks targeted by thousands of fake copycat sites,"Over 2,000 suspected copycat banking websites masquerading as real banks such as Barclays (BARC.L) or HSBC (HSBA.L) were reported in 2023 as scammers try to part unsuspecting consumers from their hard-earned cash.

The affected banks were Barclays, HSBC, Halifax, Lloyds (LLOY.L), Monzo, Nationwide, NatWest (NWG.L), Santander (BNC.L) and Starling, according to report by the consumer body and the DNS Research Federation (DNSRF), an Oxford-based non-profit that does data-driven policy research on domain names and internet governance.

The DNSRF found that more than 2,000 URLs containing specified UK bank brands were reported to a phishing blocklist in 2023. The words ""Santander"" and ""Barclays"" appeared most often in blocklists.

Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: “It’s hugely concerning that thousands of banking copycat websites were reported in a single year — potentially leaving millions of consumers exposed to fraudulent content online.

“Consumers who are just trying to bank online should not have to shoulder the responsibility of reporting scam sites and chasing domain registrars to take them down.”

The consumer group also asked more than 1,200 Which? members how much they knew about copycat banking sites. When asked if they had ever unwittingly entered their details into such websites, 2% thought they had, while a further 3% were unsure.

Only one in four (27%) knew that you could use a domain lookup service such as who.is to see when a site was registered. Doing this would allow consumers to spot a brand-new website masquerading as a long-established bank.

The vast majority of respondents were able to identify that strange or unofficial-looking web addresses, poor spelling and grammar were hallmarks of a scam site.

The consumer body is calling for new legal duties to force domain registrars to do more to prevent these scams appearing in the first place.

“Domain registrars have a much bigger role to play in the fight against online fraud. With an election just around the corner, the next government must make fighting fraud a national priority, and place new legal duties on these companies to prevent scammers from setting up these fraudulent copycat websites,” Concha said.

The UK government is currently consulting on new powers to seize domains being used for criminal purposes.

Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds Bank said: “We recognise the threat posed by fraudsters attempting to impersonate our brands. This problem isn’t unique to us, unfortunately all major companies are targeted by organised crime groups."""
Here's Why We Think Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) Is Well Worth Watching,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.

So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Lloyds Banking Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.

How Fast Is Lloyds Banking Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?
In the last three years Lloyds Banking Group's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Lloyds Banking Group's EPS shot up from UK£0.049 to UK£0.078; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a commendable gain of 58%.

Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It's noted that Lloyds Banking Group's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for Lloyds Banking Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 27% to UK£18b. That's a real positive.

In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.

Are Lloyds Banking Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a UK£33b company like Lloyds Banking Group. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. To be specific, they have UK£22m worth of shares. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Even though that's only about 0.07% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.

Should You Add Lloyds Banking Group To Your Watchlist?
For growth investors, Lloyds Banking Group's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Lloyds Banking Group that you should be aware of.

Rothesay buys 6 billion pound Scottish Widows bulk annuities from Lloyds,"(Reuters) - Pension insurance specialist Rothesay has agreed to buy the about 6 billion pound ($7.67 billion) Scottish Widows in force bulk annuity portfolio from Lloyds Banking Group, the companies said on Wednesday.

The bulk annuity deal covers the pension benefits of about 42,000 people and marks its sixth acquisition of annuities, Rothesay said in a statement.

""This sale will enable us to focus and invest in the insurance, pensions, investments, retirement and protection markets where we want to grow,"" said Chira Barua, CEO of Scottish Widows and of insurance, pensions and investments at Lloyds.

Bulk annuities, which have grown in popularity in the UK among pension scheme trustees, are a form of insurance whereby a company's pension plan offloads liabilities to an insurer.

Consultants expect the UK bulk annuity market to hit record levels of more than 50 billion pounds this year.

One million car finance complaints sent via Martin Lewis’s email tool,"More than one million complaints have been submitted by consumers over concerns they may have been overcharged car finance, raising the possibility of major compensation payouts, according to MoneySavingExpert.com.

Consumer champion Martin Lewis said car finance mis-selling has the potential to be the “second biggest reclaim payout in UK history” after the PPI scandal.

About 1.1 million complaint emails have been sent out through a free tool on the MoneySavingExpert.com website, which was founded by Mr Lewis, amounting to about 30,000 per day.

The tool and guide were launched on February 6 in response to the UK’s financial regulator opening a major probe into hidden and unfair selling practices in the car finance market.

Before being banned in January 2021, some lenders allowed brokers to adjust the interest rates they offered customers for a loan, which could mean they received more cash in commission.

Research found that the selling practice, known as a discretionary commission arrangement, led to higher finance costs and was unfair to consumers.

Black Horse is currently the most complained-about lender via MoneySavingExpert’s car finance tool, with about 16% of the total number.

Owned by Lloyds Banking Group, the dealer offer loans on cars including Jaguar, Land Rover and Suzuki.

Lloyds last month said it was setting aside about £450 million to cover potential costs relating to the issue and potential compensation payouts for customers.

We've now hit 1,000,000 car finance reclaim complaints via our free tool in around a month from launch. Full info including a breakdown of the firms most complained to… https://t.co/XqAaBs7vN7

— Martin Lewis (@MartinSLewis) March 11, 2024

Volkswagen Financial Services has emerged as the second most complained-about lender, followed by Stellantis Financial Services and Santander, according to the consumer platform.

Mr Lewis said: “The numbers of complaints in not much more than a month is staggering – off the charts – far more than I expected.

“So, it’s not surprising that some firms are struggling to respond to complaints in a decent time.

“To frustrated complainers, I’d say for now we should be prepared to give companies some wriggle room on timings, but firms need to urgently step up their complaint-handling resources.”

He also said the motor finance issue “feels like it is building up even more quicky” than the PPI mis-selling scandal which rocked UK lenders in previous years, based on the number of complaints.

Lloyds had to pay billions of pounds to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance from the mid-1990s.

“In value terms, car finance mis-selling is potentially going to be the second biggest reclaim payout in UK history – possibly over £10 billion repaid – which could even provide a fillip to the economy as PPI did,” Mr Lewis said.

Meanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it wants to make sure customers are given compensation in an orderly and efficient way, if it finds they have lost out due to widespread misconduct.

This could mean setting up a formal redress scheme. The watchdog is due to set out its next steps by the end of September.

The MoneySavingExpert.com tool helps people build an email and submit it to their car finance provider, if they think they are likely to be affected.

Mr Lewis said if people think they could be eligible then they should consider logging a complaint “sooner than later”."
Analysts Are Updating Their Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON:LLOY) Estimates After Its Yearly Results,"It's been a good week for Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON:LLOY) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest full-year results, and the shares gained 5.3% to UK£0.45. Results look mixed - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at UK£18b, statutory earnings were in line with expectations, at UK£0.075 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Lloyds Banking Group after the latest results.

Check out our latest analysis for Lloyds Banking Group

earnings-and-revenue-growth
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Following last week's earnings report, Lloyds Banking Group's 15 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be UK£18.4b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to fall 17% to UK£0.064 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of UK£18.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of UK£0.061 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Lloyds Banking Group's earnings potential following these results.

The consensus price target was unchanged at UK£0.59, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Lloyds Banking Group analyst has a price target of UK£0.80 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at UK£0.41. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.

One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Lloyds Banking Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.5% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 2.6% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.8% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Lloyds Banking Group is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.

The Bottom Line
The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Lloyds Banking Group's earnings potential next year. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.

Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Lloyds Banking Group going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Lloyds Banking Group (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

 Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 22, 2024

Lloyds Banking Group plc isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Charles Nunn: Good morning, everyone, and thanks very much for joining us at our 2023 full year results presentation. In line with prior results, I'll begin with a short overview of the group's financial and strategic performance. William will then provide the usual detail on our financials. Following a brief summary, we'll then take your questions. Let me begin on Slide 3. I'm really pleased with the progress we've made on implementing our customer-focused strategy, whilst at the same time, delivering strong outcomes for our shareholders. Now there are lots of moving parts in Q4 that William will talk through shortly. But underlying that, the business has performed strongly. With that in mind, I'd like to highlight the following 3 things.

Firstly, we've now completed the second year of our strategic transformation and are generating real business momentum. We remain on track to meet our strategic targeted outcomes. Secondly, we've met or exceeded the guidance that we laid out during the year, whilst taking proactive action to address a number of headwinds. Our financial performance has enabled increased capital returns of £3.8 billion in the year. And finally, we're confident of delivering higher, more sustainable returns for shareholders. Importantly, we are reiterating both our returns and capital generation for 2024 and 2026. Turning now to Slide 4, where I will highlight how we've delivered for all stakeholders in 2023. We have provided proactive and targeted support during a period of ongoing uncertainty for our customers.

An aerial shot of a business district with the company's headquarters towering above its competitors.
For example, we've contacted more than 15 million customers in 2023 to increase awareness regarding savings options and enhanced propositions. Off the back of this, more customers trusted us with their savings, with balances actually growing in the year. We've also used our data insights to contact around 7.5 million customers offering support where required. Alongside this, our purpose-driven strategy is focused on building a more inclusive society. To this end, we've provided further support to first-time buyers and the social housing sector. Those are both part of a multiyear commitment that combined totals nearly £100 billion of support since 2018. Finally, supporting the transition to a low carbon economy and creating a more sustainable future remains of great importance.

Linked to this, we are increasing our commercial banking sustainable financing target to £45 billion by 2026. Combined, these actions are representative of the strength of our purpose, helping Britain prosper, which enables us to successfully deliver for all stakeholders and deliver profitable growth for the business. On Slide 5, let me now address how we delivered for our shareholders with a brief overview of some of the key financial and nonfinancial metrics. William will take you through the detail later, but we have delivered a robust financial performance in line with both our expectations and the guidance we provided. This is despite some difficult unexpected headwinds, combined with an uncertain external environment. Net income growth of 3% was supported by growth in both net interest income and other operating income.

Combined with disciplined operating costs and strong asset quality, the group delivered a return on tangible equity of 15.8% for the year. This translated into strong capital generation of 173 basis points even after the impacts of regulatory headwinds and a provision relating to the FCA review of Motor Finance Commission arrangements. Excluding these exceptional items, our underlying capital generation was significantly stronger in excess of 200 basis points. This enabled total capital return of £3.8 billion, equivalent to around 14% of the group's market capitalization. This includes a 15% increase in the ordinary dividend as well as a share buyback of up to £2 billion. To pause briefly on the FCA motor finance review, as you will have seen, we have taken a charge of £450 million.

Lloyds reports bumper profits but sets aside £450m for FCA car finance probe,"Lloyds Banking Group has revealed its yearly profit soared by more than 50% after being boosted by higher borrowing costs, but said it set aside £450 million to cover potential costs of a major review into historic car finance selling practices.

The banking group is in the spotlight as one of the biggest motor finance providers in the UK through its brand Black Horse.

Lloyds said it made a pre-tax profit of £7.5 billion over 2023, surging by 57% compared with the £4.8 billion made in 2022, and coming in ahead of analysts’ expectations.

It marks record high earnings for the group, which is Britain’s biggest mortgage lender and includes brands Halifax and Bank of Scotland.

It was achieved as its underlying net interest income, the difference between what it makes from loans and pays out for deposits, jumped by 5% to £13.8 billion.

But the bank said it set aside a remediation charge of £450 million to cover potential costs related to the financial regulator’s probe into historic car finance selling practices.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last month opened a review into whether people could be owed compensation for being charged too much for car loans, following a high number of complaints.

The FCA said if it finds that consumers have lost out because of widespread misconduct, it will make sure they get compensation in an orderly and efficient way.

Lloyds said it was too early to say what the scale of the redress could be, and that it welcomed the watchdog’s investigation to get clarity.

“There remains significant uncertainty as to the extent of any misconduct and customer loss, if any, the nature of any remediation action, if required, and its timing,” the bank said.

The £450 million provision, which includes estimates for costs and potential compensation, could be more or less once the FCA completes its probe.

But Lloyds’ chief financial officer, William Chalmers, stressed that the car finance probe was “not like prior remediations”, when asked by reporters whether he thought it showed any similarities to the PPI mis-selling scandal.

Lloyds had to pay billions of pounds to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance from the mid-1990s.

Meanwhile, the group’s chief executive Charlie Nunn said the bank was “focused on proactively supporting people and businesses through persistent cost-of-living pressures” last year.

It reached out to about 7.5 million customers to help with their financial situations over 2023, it said.

More customers moved money into accounts with higher interest on their savings last year, but Lloyds said that trend slowed slightly during the final months of the year."
What has happened in the car finance market and will customers be compensated?,"Lloyds has become the first UK bank to set aside hundreds of millions of pounds in case it has to compensate car finance customers, amid a major investigation into whether people overpaid on their loans.

The banking group revealed a provision worth £450 million to cover potential costs relating to the issue.

Here, the PA news agency looks at what is being investigated and what could happen next for banks and consumers.

– What is the issue and why is it being investigated?

The UK’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), launched a review last month into historic commission arrangements in the motor finance market.

It said it followed a high number of complaints from customers to car finance firms.

In January 2021, the FCA banned selling practices known as discretionary commission arrangements.

It stopped lenders allowing brokers, including car dealers, to increase interest rates on car loans so they get more commission.

Research suggested it led to higher finance costs and was unfair on consumers.

– What could happen next?

The FCA said if it finds consumers have lost out because of widespread misconduct, it will make sure they get compensation in an orderly and efficient way – indicating it could set up a formal redress scheme.

The watchdog is expected to set out its next steps by the end of September.

MoneySavingExpert.com has created a tool to generate a template email for people who think they might have been overcharged interest on a car, van or motorbike bought on finance before January 28, 2021.

Consumer champion Martin Lewis, who founded the website, said some 262,500 complaint emails were sent after just one full day of the tool being launched.

– What has Lloyds said about the issue?

Lloyds has come into the spotlight because it is one of the biggest motor finance providers in the UK through its brand Black Horse.

The bank said it is too early to say what the scale of any potential redress could be, and that it welcomed the regulator’s investigation to get clarity on the issue.

Matt Brizman, an equity analyst for Hargreaves Lansdown, said the £450 million charge is “less than some had feared but there will be question marks around how Lloyds has come to that figure”.

He added: “Lloyds has been honest in saying the outcome of the review is largely unknown.

“What we do know is that Lloyds is one of the more exposed banks should the FCA deem there was misconduct and customer loss.”

– Are other banks involved?

Santander said it had received “a number of county court claims and complaints” about the issue following the FCA’s review, and it is possible it could receive more.

But the bank said: “In view of the inherent uncertainties, it is therefore also not possible to estimate the extent of any financial impact.”

Barclays, which is less exposed to the car finance market, acknowledged the review in its full-year results published this week.

Its finance director Anna Cross said because of the low number of customer complaints it had received, and uncertainty about the FCA’s final decision, the bank decided not to set aside a provision at this time.

Alex Neill, co-founder of consumer rights group Consumer Voice, said: “All car finance providers that used discretionary commission should be setting aside money to give customers back what they’re owed.

“It’s only right that all of the people who have been charged too much for their loan are compensated.”"
AI chipmaker adds $277bn in history’s biggest ever stock rally,"US microchip maker Nvidia achieved the biggest one day increase in value of any company in history as investors clamour for a stake in the AI industry.

Shares in the Californian company surged 16.4pc in New York on Thursday, adding $277bn (£219bn) to its market value.

The rise eclipsed a $197bn gain made by Meta at the start of the month to become the biggest increase in value of a company during a single market trading session.

Nvidia, which is seen as a market leader in AI chips, is now worth $1.96 trillion.

The stock price leap came after Nvidia reported that its quarterly revenues had climbed 265pc to more than $22bn. Its full-year revenues more than doubled to $60bn.

On Wednesday night, chief executive Jensen Huang said he believed the world was at an AI “tipping point” and said demand for its microchips was “surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations”.

The US company has been designing high-powered graphics processing chips that are favoured by developers.

Tech giants and nation states have been buying up hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s most powerful H100 chips. The British government has made plans to buy thousands of the company’s processors to bolster its AI supercomputing capabilities.

Nvidia’s performance sparked a broader rally for tech shares and drove the S&P 500 index to a record high, up 2.1pc to 5,087.03.

Thursday’s share price gain made Nvidia the world’s third most valuable business, above Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet. It also inflated the net worth of Mr Huang, 61, to around $59.6bn, according to Bloomberg. That leaves the entrepreneur, who cofounded Nvidia in 1993, just outside the top 20 richest people in the world.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley said Nvidia’s growth continued to be “remarkable”, while predicting “AI usage will almost certainly continue to grow”. Nvidia said it would record revenues of $24bn in the next three months alone.

However, the rapid surge in technology stock values has prompted fears of a bubble fuelled by AI mania.

Richard Windsor, an independent analyst, said: “For better or for worse, Nvidia is stuck on this rollercoaster and there is no way for it to get off should the bubble burst.”"
Lloyds sets aside £450m for car loan fines and payouts,"Lloyds Banking Group has been forced to put aside £450m for potential fines and compensation to borrowers, after the UK regulator opened an investigation into whether consumers had been charged inflated prices for car loans.

The figure falls far short of some analyst estimates, which suggest the investigation into loan and commission arrangements struck between 2007 and 2021 could end up costing Lloyds upwards of £2bn.

The consumer champion Martin Lewis said last month the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority could lead to “the new PPI” – a reference to the multibillion-pound payment protection insurance scandal – which ultimately ended up costing banks more than £40bn. Lloyds was one of the biggest offenders, with a PPI compensation bill of more than £20bn.

But Lloyds stressed there was “significant uncertainty” over the extent of any misconduct or loss to customers that could result in penalties or payouts linked to its Black Horse division, which specialises in motor finance and holds £15.3bn in loans.

Lloyds, which also owns the Bank of Scotland and Halifax brands, also said it was unclear when the FCA might complete its investigation, creating further uncertainty for the high street lender.

The industry is facing a total bill of up to £13bn, according to analysts at Jefferies, while RBC Capital is now forecasting total charges of £8bn, down from a previous range of £6bn-£16bn.

Lloyds has the biggest exposure to car loans out of the UK’s high street banks at up to £2.5bn, though Barclays and Santander UK may also face significant costs of up to £357m and £1.1bn respectively, according to RBC. The specialist lender Close Brothers, which last week suspended its dividend because of uncertainty over the FCA investigation, could suffer a £252m hit.

Bosses at Barclays, which stopped offering new car loans in 2019, said this week that they did not feel it was necessary to put aside cash for the investigation, “reflecting that uncertainty, but also the very low levels of complaints that we’ve actually received”.

On the cost of the motor finance investigation, the Lloyds chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said: “[The] actual amounts could be higher or lower than the provision that we’ve taken, and we just have to see how things develop over the course of the coming months.”

Asked whether former Lloyds executives could face penalties such as clawbacks in pay if they were found to be responsible for any potential wrongdoing, Nunn said it would be a decision for the bank’s board of directors. He took over as chief executive of Lloyds in the summer of 2021.

The charge has already taken its toll on the bonus pool, which fell to £384m in 2023, compared with £446m a year earlier. Lloyds did not disclose how much of the drop reflected the potential impact of the FCA investigation.

Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The £450m provision was less than some had feared, but there will be question marks around how Lloyds has come to that figure.”

“Lloyds has been honest in saying the outcome of the review is largely unknown. What we do know is that Lloyds is one of the more exposed banks should the FCA deem there was misconduct and customer loss,” he added.

Lloyds’s latest charge did not weigh on the bank’s annual pre-tax profits of £7.5bn, up 57% on the £4.8m a year earlier. The bank was helped by a 3% rise in net interest income – which accounts for the difference between what is paid to savers compared with what is charged to loans and mortgage customers – to £13.3bn.

Nunn received a £3.7m pay package, including a £1.3m bonus. That was down slightly from the £3.8m in total pay he was granted for 2022.

Lloyds also announced a dividend of 1.84 pence a share, as well as a £2bn share buyback, which analysts said should assure some investors who may be spooked by uncertainty over the motor finance investigation. Lloyds’ shares rose by 3% on Thursday.

Edward Firth, the managing director of UK banks research at KBW, said: “It is highly unlikely that the £450m charge will be the end of the story. But it is orders of magnitude below market fears, and the fact that the regulator approved a £2bn buyback does suggest that they are not expecting outsized charges later this year.”"
Lloyds Bank posts record profit amid higher interest rates,"Lloyds Banking Group reported a 57% jump in annual profit for 2023 as it generated more income from higher interest rates that continue to squeeze most UK households.

The lender reported a pre-tax profit of £7.5bn ($9.5bn ) over 2023, surging by 57% compared with the £4.8bn made in 2022.

The group – which includes Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows – announced a final dividend of 1.84 pence and a share buyback of £2bn. Lloyds net interest margin – the difference between what it charges for loans and pays out on savings – rose 17 basis points to 3.11%.

Underlying pre-tax profits for the last quarter of the year slipped to £1.7bn due to mortgage pricing and deposit mix headwinds.

Lloyds’ chief executive Charlie Nunn said the group was “focused on proactively supporting people and businesses through persistent cost of living pressures” during 2023.

Charges for debts not being repaid by customers fell sharply to £308m. Customer deposits fell by £3.9bn to £471.4bn.

The bank said it set aside a remediation charge of £450m to cover potential costs related to the financial regulator’s review into historic car finance selling practices.

That suggests the bill across the whole banking sector could run into billions of pounds. Lloyds owns Black Horse, one of the biggest lenders in the car finance market.

The bank said: “There remains significant uncertainty as to the extent of any misconduct and customer loss, if any, the nature of any remediation action, if required, and its timing. Hence the impact could materially differ from the provision, both higher or lower.”

CEO total remuneration came in at £3.7m last year, down 2% on 2022. Total GPS bonus pot for group reached £384m.

Max Georgiou, analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""Lloyd's profit beat highlights a good step towards their 2026 strategic targets, the high rate environment has been conducive to this given the more “prime” focus of their assets and liabilities.

""The FCA motor finance review could present challenges in the future, Lloyds is thought to have the largest exposure across UK peers and could present a challenge in RoTE targets moving forward."""
Lloyds announces record annual profits but sets aside £450m for FCA motor finance probe,"Lloyds Banking Group has reported an uptick in annual profits on the back of higher interest rates while setting aside £450m for an FCA motor finance probe.

The group also announced it was planning an up to £2bn share buyback, which together with a 1.84p per share final dividend would see £3.8bn returned to shareholders.

Britain’s largest domestic banking group – which owns Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows – posted a pretax profit of £7.5bn for 2023, up 57 per cent from £4.8bn in 2022 and an all-time high for the lender. Analysts had expected a figure of £7.4bn.

The bank’s net interest income rose to £13.3bn in 2023, from £12.9bn in 2022. However, its net interest margin narrowed by 0.1 per cent to 2.98 per cent between the third and fourth quarters as the group faced pressure to offer savers better deals and a likely peak in interest rates.

Investors have been clamouring for more details on Lloyds’ exposure to an FCA review into now-banned motor finance commission arrangements.

Today the bank confirmed it made a £450m provision for the potential impact of the review, which it said included “estimates for costs and potential redress”.

“There remains significant uncertainty as to the extent of any misconduct and customer loss, if any, the nature of any remediation action, if required, and its timing,” Lloyds said. “Hence the impact could materially differ from the provision, both higher or lower.”

Analysts have estimated that the auto lending industry could be on the hook for up to £16bn in compensation payouts from the FCA’s probe.

RBC estimates that Lloyds, the owner of the UK’s largest auto lender Black Horse, could be on the hook for up to £2bn in compensation but flagged that it would not know the size and scope of the issue until at least September.

Although some experts have likened the motor finance probe to the PPI scandal, Lloyds chief financial officer William Chalmers stressed in a call with reporters that it was “not like prior remediations”.

Lloyds posted loan impairments of £303m in 2023, down from £1.5bn in 2022. It explained that the year-on-year decrease included “a significant write-back and improved economic assumptions”.

The Barclay family paid £1.2bn in debts owed to Lloyds in December to regain ownership of The Telegraph.

Lloyds saw operating costs of £9.1bn in 2023, up five per cent year-on-year but in line with guidance. It expected operating costs to rise to around £9.3bn in 2024, reflecting severance charges and inflation.

The bank confirmed last month that it had cut 1,600 jobs across its branch network in a bid to reduce costs and transition to online banking.

Chief executive Charlie Nunn said on Thursday: “2023 was a critical year in building towards the ambitious strategy we announced two years ago, as we look to grow our business and deepen relationships with our customers.

“As demonstrated in our recent strategic seminars, we have made significant progress and are on track to meet our 2024 and 2026 strategic outcomes, helping us build towards higher and more sustainable returns.”

Despite the jump in profits, the bank’s bonus pool fell to £384m for 2023, from £466m in 2022. Nunn received a £3.7m pay package, down from £3.8m in 2022.

Lloyds shares dropped 1.7 per cent on Thursday morning."
"Lloyds profit jumps despite UK outlook, motor finance provision","LONDON (Reuters) -Lloyds Banking Group reported a 57% jump in profit for 2023 on Thursday, as Britain's faltering economy and a charge for potential costs from a regulatory review into motor finance failed to put a major dent in its performance.

Lloyds reported pre-tax profit of 7.5 billion pounds ($9.5 billion) for the 12-month period, up from 4.8 billion pounds the prior year and slightly above the 7.4 billion pounds average of analyst forecasts compiled by the bank.

The group - which also spans the Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows brands - announced a final dividend of 1.84 pence and a share buyback of 2 billion pounds.

As Britain's biggest domestic lender, Lloyds' fortunes are inextricably linked with those of the wider economy - which official data showed this month entered a recession in the second half of 2023.

But like its rivals, Lloyds has enjoyed a huge boost to lending revenues from higher Bank of England interest rates - which underpin borrowing costs - while containing losses from potential bad loans as more borrowers feel the pinch.

Lloyds set aside 308 million pounds to cover potential unpaid loans, well down on 1.5 billion pounds the prior year.

The bank also set out muted performance guidance for the year ahead, amid tougher competition for mortgage and deposit pricing.

The bank reported a net interest margin - a key measure of underlying bank profitability - of 2.98% in the final three months of the year, down on 3.08% in the third quarter.

Lloyds said its NIM was forecast to fall to 2.9% this year. That in turn drove guidance for returns for 2024 to just 13%, down from 15.8% in 2023 before recovering to 15% by 2026, the bank said.

PROVISION

One potential major risk ahead for Lloyds lies in an ongoing regulatory review into suspected historic overcharging by car finance lenders - a market in which the bank is a big player through its subsidiary Black Horse.

Lloyds set aside 450 million pounds to cover possible redress. Some analysts estimate the bank's potential costs could rise as high as 2 billion pounds.

Analysts at RBC have estimated the sector's total compensation bill could reach 16 billion pounds, which would make it the costliest banking scandal since mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI).

Lloyds also announced it had appointed former Banco Santander executive Nathan Bostock to its board, after deputy chairman Alan Dickinson said he would step down on completing nine years of service.

Bostock was chief executive officer of the Spanish lender's UK arm from 2014 until 2022, and before that served briefly as finance director for RBS.

Lloyds Bank creates new account aimed at budding Gen-Z investors,"A new account aimed at Generation Z adults taking their first step into investing has been created by Lloyds Bank.

Invest Wise carries no admin fee for 18 to 25-year-olds and account holders can operate it alongside their everyday banking in the Lloyds Bank app.

From the age of 26, the admin fee is £40 per year.

People can invest into an Invest Wise Isa or a non-Isa Invest Wise account, putting away from £20 per month.

The service will be available to Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers, called 18-25 Investing.

The value of investments can go down as well as up and investments are intended to be for the longer-term. Some people who are looking for guaranteed returns may prefer to keep their savings in cash. Some people may also want to consider getting financial advice when deciding what to do with their money.

An Opinium survey for Lloyds found that buying a house or paying off a mortgage is the top investment goal among 18 to 25-year-olds.

Two-fifths (42%) also said they turn to their parents for help with money.

Manuel Pardavila-Gonzalez, managing director at Lloyds Bank Investments, said: “Seeing more young people switched on to investing and using it to connect with their life goals means we need to do more to help them start making their money work harder now.

“Parents can also play an important part in talking about managing money and financial future with the family.”

Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said: “The Invest Wise account and Invest Wise Isa could be an enticing way for consumers to dip their toe into funds, and those aged between 18 to 25 don’t pay an admin fee.

“The convenience to monitor these accounts within the Lloyds app may also be helpful to those who want to keep a close eye on their pots, and prefer mobile banking.

“Traditionally, stocks and shares Isas would be chosen by investors who are prepared to invest for better returns over the longer-term on the basis that performance might fluctuate over shorter timescales but it is essential (for investors) to regularly check the performance of their pot and seek advice if they need to review their risk profile.

“Those who want to start saving for their first home could open a Lifetime Isa, where the Government will apply a bonus of 25% on contributions, but savers will need to check the terms and conditions of these accounts to ensure it suits their needs.

“The most suitable account for any saver will depend on their own circumstances. Those considering stocks and shares must keep in mind that past performance is never guaranteed to be reflected in future returns, so it’s crucial investors are comfortable with their attitude to risk.

“Those who are unsure may avoid investing altogether and keep their pot earning interest instead, but this attitude is always worth reviewing.”"
"Following a 12% decline over last year, recent gains may please Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON:LLOY) institutional owners","Key Insights
Significantly high institutional ownership implies Lloyds Banking Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

50% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders

Insiders have been selling lately

If you want to know who really controls Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON:LLOY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Last week's UK£1.1b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 12% losses.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Lloyds Banking Group.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lloyds Banking Group?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Lloyds Banking Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lloyds Banking Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

earnings-and-revenue-growth
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lloyds Banking Group. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 8.1%. With 4.7% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Harris Associates L.P. are the second and third largest shareholders.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Lloyds Banking Group
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that Lloyds Banking Group plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own UK£17m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in Lloyds Banking Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Lloyds Banking Group has 2 warning signs (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Banks brace for another ‘mis-selling’ car crash,"When Mrs Young spent over £7,600 on a used car in 2016, little did she know the tsunami of woes she was about to unleash on the UK banking sector.

That’s because Mrs Young was ‘unfairly’ sold a loan to pay for her car.

Lloyds Banking Group’s finance arm, Black Horse, was the lender involved and had paid a commission to the car dealership to increase the rate on Mrs Young’s loan.

Mrs Young, whose first name has not been disclosed in case documents, subsequently challenged the terms of the loan. Her experience has become a test case at the centre of a major investigation into whether banks knowingly ripped off customers through mis-sold motor finance.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has launched an investigation into the matter and is expected to report back in September.

The inquiry has sparked fears that banks could be facing a new PPI-style scandal that could drag on for years and prove hugely costly.


Estimates as to just how costly vary: Citi predicts up to £9bn of possible charges for banks. HSBC analysts say the issue could cost as much as £16bn.

Last week merchant bank Close Brothers, which offered loans to car buyers across 4,000 dealerships, axed a £100m dividend over fears about the scale of the FCA investigation.

“The banks are in this holding pattern because it’s yet to be determined whether there is systemic harm with the discretionary commission models,” said Kate Robinson at Avyse Partners, which advises lenders on regulatory issues.

Like many drivers, Mrs Young had bought her car using a loan from Black Horse, which controls 20pc of the car finance market. It had been arranged at her car dealership by the salesman, who was also a regulated loan broker.

Unbeknown to her, the salesman stood to earn a secret commission if Mrs Young agreed to a higher interest rate on her loan. She had already been turned down for four other loans, making her more vulnerable to accepting the deal.

Mrs Young ended up paying hundreds of pounds more than she otherwise would have done, according to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS),

Her compensation case, brought by law firm Bott and Co, was upheld last month because she wasn’t told about the arrangement. She was awarded £630.

While her award is comparatively small, the scale of the car finance industry means the issue could prove hugely costly if mis-selling is uncovered on a market-wide scale.


Mrs Young was one of thousands who took part in a car finance lending boom during the 2010s. Gross lending for private car sales at dealerships almost tripled between 2011 and 2018, from £14bn to £47bn according to HSBC.

The FCA has for now blocked any further compensation claims until its investigation is complete. It is looking at car loans from as far back as 2007.

Robinson says the issue is not “black and white”.

“The responsibility has been pushed towards the banks but the brokers were involved in this process. From a lender’s point of view, these lenders have been held to the fire somewhat by brokers.”

While the official investigation may be ongoing, stock analysts have been quick to map the likely fallout.

According to HSBC, Lloyds is the most exposed because of its ownership of Black Horse. Estimates as to how much it may cost Lloyds range from £1.3bn to £2.4bn.

Investors are likely to raise the issue with Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn this week when the bank delivers its annual results.

Nunn is expected to reveal a big buyback of shares, with a £2.2bn payout forecast by the City. However, concerns about the car finance issue mean analysts are expecting the bank to register some form of remediation charge.

Lloyds is not the only bank involved. The ombudsman has also taken aim at Barclays, which made loans through its subsidiary Clydesdale Financial Services, trading as Barclays Partner Finance."
U-turn and profits dip add up to tricky sell for Barclays,"Barclays chief executive CS Venkat­akrishnan has a tough act to follow. Just days after rival NatWest revealed its biggest profit since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, the Barclays boss will be delivering much less cheering news: cost cuts, job losses and restructuring plans are all expected to feature in the bank’s first major strategy update in a decade.

Tuesday’s results will also be a lesson in salesmanship: how to promise better times after reporting yet another slip in annual profits.

Analysts are expecting the chief executive – who is known to colleagues as “Venkat” – to reveal a 4.5% fall in pre-tax profits, to £6.7bn. Although UK lenders have benefited from higher charges on loans and mortgages – thanks to the fastest rise in interest rates since the 1970s – at Barclays those earnings will partly be offset by restructuring costs, which are expected to result in a charge of between £700m and £1bn.

Figures from Barclays’s investment bank is also likely to be a drag on profits, following another sluggish year for deals and public listings. The downturn has already taken a toll on US rivals such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both of which reported their lowest annual profit in four years in January.

But that division’s poor performance could serve to show Venkat is on the right track. He wants to scale down the volatile investment bank side, and lean more heavily on income from wealth management and retail banking (this paved the way for Barclays’s £700m buyout of Tesco’s banking business this month).

The rub here is that he is asking shareholders to join him on what is in effect a U-turn. Venkat’s predecessor Jes Staley, now mired in controversy, spent years resisting pressure from an activist investor who also wanted to see a much smaller, if not entirely offloaded, investment bank.

“Barclays fought off calls from Edward Bramson of Sherborne Investors to spin off the unit, and rebutted suggestions that it did not earn a consistently high enough return on equity to justify the amount of group capital allocated to it,” said analysts at AJ Bell. “A bumper first quarter in 2023 helped to support Barclays’s strategy but the investment bank’s performance has ebbed since.”

The questions now are about the scale and costs of the restructuring plans. Though the costs could eat into bankers’ bonus pools, they are unlikely to have a large impact on dividends. Venkat is expected to soften the blow of another drop in profits with a dividend payout that AJ Bell expects could reach 9.5p a share, up from 7.25p in 2022.

At the very least, it will help distract from more controversial matters, including a recent report by Bloomberg which alleges that Staley stayed in touch with Jeffrey Epstein for years after taking over as Barclays chief executive – despite claims that he cut ties with the convicted sex offender in 2015.

The former Barclays boss is challenging the Financial Conduct Authority, after it ruled that he had misled the regulator over his relationship with the disgraced financier. The FCA has since banned Staley from holding any senior role in the City. Neither Staley nor Barclays have commented on the report.

UK bank announcements will continue on Wednesday, with analysts expecting HSBC to double its annual pre-tax profits, to $34bn (£27bn) from $17.5bn in 2022.

The London-headquartered lender will have benefited from rising interest rates in Asia – where it makes the bulk of its profits – and the west.

This is likely to result in another significant payout for chief executive Noel Quinn, who was handed a $5.5m package in 2022, including a $2.2m bonus.

Lloyds will be watched closely for signs of mortgage market wobbles as customers’ fixed rate loans come to an end

The earnings surge will also provide some comfort for investors worried about the impact of China’s property downturn, which led to the forced liquidation of developer Evergrande last month. “Operationally, there are some concerns investors would like reassurance on,” said Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “HSBC’s exposure to the wavering Chinese real estate sector brings added risk that further impairment charges will be needed.”

Lloyds Banking Group will also publish its annual results on Wednesday, with 2023 profits expected to rise more than 7%, to £7.4bn.

The group, which is the country’s biggest mortgage lender and owns the Halifax brand, will be watched closely for any signs of wobbles in the mortgage market, as millions of customers start to roll off fixed-rate loans and face higher monthly payments.

However, average analyst estimates suggest the money put aside for potential defaults will drop by 35%, to £975m, which could signal optimism about the UK’s economic growth over the coming months.

But some more disappointing news could emerge from its car loans division, after the FCA announced an investigation into unfair charges that some industry experts say could end up costing Lloyds up to £1.8bn."
"Lloyds, property entrepreneur, settle $1.64 bln London dispute"," Lloyds and a property entrepreneur, who sued the bank for 1.3 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) over allegations of Libor interest rate manipulation and the failure of two real estate firms, have called off a London trial, Lloyds said on Tuesday.

Lawyers for Lloyds and Ardeshir Naghshineh, whose Targetfollow property group once owned the landmark Centre Point tower in central London, told the High Court on Monday they had reached an agreement in principle on the long-running dispute.

""Mr Naghshineh has withdrawn his claim and has discontinued these proceedings,"" a Lloyds spokesperson said. ""The parties will not be commenting further.""

A spokesperson for Naghshineh was not immediately able to comment.

Naghshineh had been seeking compensation after two Targetfollow businesses went into administration in 2010. He alleged his companies would not have taken out loans, alongside interest rate derivative products, had they known about alleged Libor (London interbank offered rate) manipulation.

Lloyds had alleged that the claim had no merit and that both parties had reached a settlement more than a decade ago over banking products at the centre of the claim.

Libor, designed to represent the cost of borrowing between banks that set a benchmark for trillions of loans and contracts globally, was phased out in 2021 after a rigging scandal prompted global regulators to fine some of the world's biggest banks billions of dollars.

Lloyds in 2014 paid fines totalling $370 million for its part in the scandal and for attempting to manipulate fees for a government lending scheme to help banks.

"Santander, Lloyds' shares hit by report Iran used accounts to evade sanctions","Santander and Lloyds shares fell on Monday after the Financial Times (FT) newspaper reported that Iran used accounts held at the banks in the United Kingdom to covertly move money around the world in a sanctions-evasion scheme backed by Iran's intelligence services.

Lloyds and Santander UK provided accounts to British front companies allegedly secretly owned by a sanctioned Iranian petrochemicals company based in London, the FT reported citing documents the newspaper had obtained.

Shares in Madrid-based parent Santander fell as much as 6.1% and were down 4.9% at 1503 GMT, wiping off around 3 billion euros in value from the euro zone's second biggest lender by market capitalisation, according to data from LSEG, while shares in Lloyds declined 0.5%.

Santander shares rose more than 6% last week following 2023 earnings that beat forecasts.

""The market must be realising that they may be fined,"" said Nuria Alvarez, an analyst at Madrid-based broker Renta 4.

Santander and Lloyds said in separate statements that they believed they were not in breach of sanctions, based on their own investigations.

""We have policies and procedures in place to ensure we comply with sanctions requirements and will continue to engage proactively with relevant UK and U.S. authorities,"" a Santander spokesperson said.

A Lloyds spokesperson said the group was committed to adhering to economic crime laws and regulations, adding it could not comment on individual customers.

British regulator the Financial Conduct Authority said it was in contact with the banks and with the UK's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).

The U.S. Treasury Department and Britain's foreign ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

European lenders, such as Unicredit and Standard Chartered, have been hit with large penalties over Iran sanctions in the past, with the Italian lender paying $1.3 billion to U.S. authorities to settle probes.

Standard Chartered agreed to pay $1.1 billion in 2019 to U.S. and British authorities over financial transactions that violated sanctions against Iran and other countries.

According to the FT, the Iranian state-controlled Petrochemical Commercial Company was part of a network that the United States accuses of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force and of working with Russian intelligence agencies.

Both PCC and its British subsidiary PCC UK have been under U.S. sanctions since November 2018, the FT said.

One of its alleged front companies, called Pisco UK, is registered to a detached house in Surrey and used a business account with Santander UK, the FT report said.

A person with knowledge of the situation said that Santander has closed Pisco's account.

Santander declined to comment on specific client relationships.

Alicia Kearns, chair of Britain's foreign affairs committee, said she had repeatedly raised concerns about the need to shut down ""cut-outs"" of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps operating in the UK, adding that the FT report suggested more needed to be done."
We are on a cliff edge’ – rural communities hit by new banking betrayal,"For more than a century, Lloyds Bank was a key fixture of the high street in Cricklade, Wiltshire. Its name is carved into a grand old building, and many of the town’s residents chose Lloyds in the first place because it was the only bank in town.

But Lloyds shuttered its branch around a decade ago; now the building is covered in scaffolding, taken over by an outdoor sports shop.

So as to not abandon its customers entirely, in 2018 Lloyds launched a “mobile banking hub service” – vans containing miniature branches that were driven around rural areas.

They toured a set route throughout the day, setting up shop in market squares and car parks three times a week.

After lockdown lifted, however, Lloyds began to cut the number of vans, citing a low number of users. Now, it visits Cricklade just once a fortnight – and on Monday Lloyds announced that from May it would be scrapping the service completely in dozens of small towns, including Cricklade and Fairford in Gloucestershire, across the country.

This week The Telegraph followed the van as it travelled through small towns, including Fairford and Cricklade, to meet the people who would be cut off from banking.

A vital lifeline
In Fairford, the van parks in the town square on market day for about four hours. Here today are Dave and Anne Bowman – lifelong Lloyds customers for no other reason than it was the only bank with a high street branch in Fairford. They are here to make use of the mobile hub to deposit cheques and withdraw cash.

Anne and David Bowman

Though the mobile hub is not perfect and struggles with an intermittent internet signal, it provides customers like Mr and Mrs Bowman with much-needed face-to-face contact with a branch manager, who became known in the community.

“As a society now we’re concerned a lot about mindfulness and wellbeing,” says Mr Bowman, 68. “Going in and having a chat was doing a society-type thing.”

When announcing the shutdown, Lloyds claimed that “customers have used our mobile branches much less over time and some locations now have as few as two customers using the service”.

But despite Lloyds’ claims, residents were well aware of when the bank on wheels would arrive and spoke of their dismay that they were being left with no alternative but to travel miles to access a branch.

After the van makes its last visit in May, the town’s last form of cash access will be a Post Office; the nearest cash machine is four miles away in Lechdale. Should Mrs Bowman, 66, who uses a wheelchair, want to visit a branch, she will have to travel 10 miles to Cirencester to do so.

A report published by Lloyds on Monday claimed just 67 customers used the service regularly across the Gloucestershire route, which includes six stops in total. But John Read, 82, has regularly seen customers queueing outside the van.

“For some reason, those figures aren’t being put into their books,” he says.

A Lloyds bank spokesman said: “The vast majority of customers already use other ways to bank and, since November, we’ve been helping our customers learn more about the different ways to bank.”

Fairford has a sizeable population over the age of retirement - John Lawrence
Fairford has an estimated population of 4,200 – a quarter of them pensioners – according to census data.

Mr Read says: “As you get older you may not be able to use iPhones and iPads. Some of us can, but for those who can’t, it’s what you might call digital poverty. Then there’s transport poverty – many people lose their driving licence in their 80s.

“If you can only use the typical old-style bank and you can’t use a car, how do you get to where it is? It’s a real problem.”

‘We’re on a cliff edge’
Cllr Richard Harrison, chairman of Fairford town council planning committee, has watched as key services have vanished from the high street, to be replaced by gift shops and hotels.

“We’re on a cliff edge,” he says.

“We need more services here so our ageing population isn’t forced to travel to access key services like in-person banking.”

Councillor Richard Harrison
Councillor Richard Harrison says the lack of local key services is forcing elderly residents to travel in search of them - John Lawrence
James Gray, Conservative MP for North Wiltshire, said he was “extremely angry and disappointed” at the withdrawal of the service.

“I have used it myself and it’s very important – the market in Fairford only takes cash,” he said.

“It’s fine for some who can do online banking but shopkeepers with large amounts of cash and coins rely on services like these.”

Vowing to raise the issue in Parliament, Mr Gray added: “These are national decisions – clearly someone somewhere has made the call to close down these mobile banking hubs across the country and they haven’t looked at areas individually.”

‘I feel sorry for the elderly here’
After lunch, the van makes its way to Cricklade. In the absence of a market square, it sets up shop in a surgery car park off the high street. Tucked away though it may be – within 10 minutes there is a sizeable queue of pensioners waiting to be seen. In the hour it spends here, roughly a dozen customers visit the van.

Sarah Draper, 52, is the local church treasurer and uses the banking hub every time it visits to deposit collection money.

“I’ve lived here 12 years and when we first came we had a proper bank three days a week, then they cut that and introduced the vans, now they’re cutting those – it’s a pain,” she says.

“I feel sorry for the elderly here who struggle with online banking. Others would come here on motorised scooters and it would be difficult for them to get on the bus to travel further for a bank.”

A Lloyds Bank spokesman said: “In both Cricklade and Fairford, our mobile branch parks less than a minute’s walk from the Post Office, where customers can pay in coins, cash and cheques.”

But there is a problem for those who need cash services: the local Post Office is reluctant to accept coins.

Ms Draper says: “I shall have to get in my car and drive eight miles to Cirencester, paying for parking, fuel and it’s not even for me – it’s for the church.”

Mark Clarke, chairman of Cricklade town council, saw the writing on the wall when Lloyds cut the number of visits from three times a week to once a fortnight.

The council even waived parking charges to encourage it to stay. “If it were a burger van we’d charge them,” he said. “Lloyds advertises itself as ‘by your side’ but we’re watching as it leaves ours.”"
Bank agrees payout over mortgages that ‘ruined lives’,"One of Britain’s biggest high street banks has agreed a payout to settle a case involving “unfair” mortgages – giving hope to thousands of people who have been left owing huge sums.

On the eve of a trial set to last six weeks, Bank of Scotland – part of Lloyds Banking Group – and a law firm representing 160 current and former customers reached an out-of-court settlement that means the bank will not face a public grilling.

The case involves a Bank of Scotland product called the shared appreciation mortgage (Sam), which has been accused of ruining lives by leaving some people owing 10 or 12 times the sum they originally borrowed.

Teacher Stern, the law firm behind the action, had claimed that Sams were “entirely unfair” products that have left borrowers trapped in their homes, unable to sell up.

The settlement is cloaked in secrecy, with the bank and the law firm only saying they had “agreed a commercial settlement, without any admission of liability”.

Nothing was disclosed about how much money has changed hands, although some of the affected borrowers have been saddled with debts of several hundred thousand pounds – and some owe in excess of £1m.

Individuals who join a claim of this type will sometimes be asked to pay a fee of perhaps £10,000. That may suggest the affected borrowers would not have agreed to forgo their day in court unless they secured a reasonable payout.

Those who were eagerly awaiting the court case – which was due to start on 31 January – included Gary Cooper, whose case was featured in Guardian Money just before Christmas.

His parents took out a £42,500 Sam loan that has ballooned into a debt currently estimated at more than £500,000. The amount owed is so large because the deal they signed entitled the lender to 75% of any house price rise over the life of the loan.

Bank of Scotland sold thousands of Sam mortgages between late 1996 and early 1998, and an estimated 2,000-plus people still have one. The other bank that sold Sam loans for a brief period was Barclays.

They typically allowed people to borrow up to 25% of the property’s value, and usually there were no repayments to make during the lifetime of the loan.

In return, borrowers were required to pay back the original amount plus a share of any increase in the value of their home when the mortgage was repaid, or when they died and the house was sold.

This share was usually worked out on a three-to-one basis – so if someone borrowed 25% of the value, they would be in line to hand over 75% of the future growth in value.

Cooper – who is not one of the 160 claimants – is hopeful that the settlement may provide a way forward that will help others.

A joint statement from Bank of Scotland and Teacher Stern said: “The terms of the settlement agreement are confidential. There are no changes to the mortgages or their terms and conditions.”

The bank has previously said that it recommended borrowers took financial advice to ensure they understood the product and that it was suitable for their needs, and added that all borrowers were advised by their own solicitor."
Lloyds to scrap mobile banking vans which help ‘as little as two customers’,"Lloyds Banking Group is scrapping its mobile banking vans in May as part of its transition to digital banking, with demand for the service tumbling in recent years.

UK banks are increasingly transitioning to online services as fewer customers rely exclusively on branch networks, which are costly to run.

Lloyds, Britain’s largest domestic bank, last week confirmed that it would cut around 1,600 jobs across its branch network.

The company told City A.M. that just eight per cent of its 21m customers still choose to bank with branches only.

A spokesperson said on Monday that “as little as two customers” were now using Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland’s mobile banking service in some locations.

Lloyds has published statistics for the last six months showing that average visits to its mobile banking branches have fallen 90 per cent since 2018 – to 14 customers each.

The scheme acts as an alternative to high street branches, with vans visiting communities across the country to provide in-person banking services.

The spokesperson added that the group would introduce 32 additional “community bankers” to areas affected by the withdrawal of mobile services, who can set up temporary face-to-face services.

They noted “other options customers already have for their banking, including the Post Office, online, our mobile apps, phone banking, video services and web chat”.

As well as cutting branch jobs, Lloyds plans to create some 830 roles in an expanded “relationship growth” team, which it said would improve customer service."
Lloyds to scrap mobile bank branches which help ‘as little as two’ customers,"Lloyds Banking Group is shutting down its mobile banking service this year, after revealing plans to shed 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it moves ahead in the shift towards online banking.

The banking giant has been informing staff and customers of plans to scrap the Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland mobile branches in May.

Lloyds runs the service as an alternative to high street branches, with vans visiting towns and cities across the UK.

Customers can visit the mobile branches during set days and times, for services including cashing in cheques, withdrawing cash, paying bills, sending money abroad, or for general inquiries about their accounts.

But Lloyds said it has decided to end the service because it is being used less by customers.

A spokeswoman said: “Customers have used our mobile branches much less over time and some locations now have as little as two customers using the service.

“We’ll be introducing more community bankers, alongside the other options customers already have for their banking, including the Post Office, online, our mobile apps, phone banking, video services and web chat.”

Lloyds published details of its decision to close the service for each location, including a breakdown of how many customers regularly visited the specific route over the past six months – with some areas showing a single-digit figure.

Each mobile branch helps 14 customers on average, with visits falling by 90% since 2018.

It said it will be sending out 32 more community bankers to provide face-to-face banking support in areas where a mobile branch is stopping, alongside the existing network.

These are representatives from the bank who set up a temporary service in community spaces or banking hubs, where people can make payments or get help managing their accounts.

Lloyds said people can still do their banking online, over the phone, or at a Post Office, and at its more than 1,000 branches across the UK.

The decision to axe the service comes as the group revealed it is cutting jobs across its branches as part of an ongoing shift away from face-to-face banking and towards mobile banking.

It said just 8% of its customers choose to visit high street branches as the sole way to manage their money.

Some 830 jobs are being created to expand the bank’s “relationship growth” team, which it said will improve its service for customers."
"Lloyds Bank to cut 1,600 jobs across branches in shift to online banking","Lloyds Banking Group has said it is cutting about 1,600 jobs across its branch network, as part of an ongoing shift towards online banking.

The role reductions follow a tranche of branch closures announced last year as the group said the way customers are choosing to do their banking has changed “rapidly” in recent years.

The overhaul will also see the banking giant create 830 roles in an expanded “relationship growth” team, where more staff will be available to talk to customers in branches, through video meetings or over the phone.

The new team is expected to improve Lloyds’ service and lead to more customers reaching the bank without having to wait for appointments as often, it said.

The redundancies are not expected to affect the most junior employees, and in some situations staff will be offered voluntary redundancy.

Some affected staff may also have the opportunity to move to a newly created role or to a different part of the business.

The group, which owns Lloyds, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland, said just 8% of its customers choose to visit high street branches as the sole way to manage their money.

More than 21 million customers use online or mobile banking.

A spokeswoman for Lloyds said: “As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it’s important our people are available when it matters most.

“We’re introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to.”

The bank did not specify which branches would be affected by the changes.

In November, Lloyds said it was shutting another 45 branches across its network, meaning that at least 275 branches will be cut across Lloyds, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland over 2023 and 2024.

There were hundreds of branch closures across the sector last year as the exodus from the high street picked up pace.

Employee union Accord, which says it represents about 22,000 staff at Lloyds and TSB, said the changes are expected to significantly affect the branch network and its members."
Lloyds scraps fleet of mobile van branches in blow to face-to-face banking,"Lloyds is ending its mobile banking van service in a blow to thousands who have already lost their last remaining bank branch.

The banking van service was set up to serve rural towns and villages where Lloyds had shut the local branch, visiting 170 locations every fortnight.

Some 6,500 customers relied on these vans to withdraw cash, make deposits and cash in cheques.

But Lloyds said “following an in-depth review”, banking vans will cease to exist from May 31, 2024. It put the decision down to customers “using them less” and “choosing other ways to bank instead”.

The high-street bank is already set to close a further 120 branches this year and axe another 1,600 jobs as it shifts more deeply into online banking.

In 39 areas, such as Rye, Dartmouth, and Bellingham, the bank has said it will send out a “community banker”.

Once a week, these representatives will set up shop in a so-called banking hub run by Post Office staff – but they can only take payments.

Banking hubs have been hailed as the fix for towns left without any bank branches, but so far only a minority of the 76 in the pipeline have opened due to a lack of suitable retail space.

Cross-bench MPs have long railed against bank branch closures after receiving complaints from their constituents about towns being left bankless.

Over 5,764 branches have shut their doors since 2015, according to Which?, leaving around 4,000 still in operation.

In November, Barclays began stationing a banking van for customers in a Hove graveyard after it closed its last branch in the area.

The bank said the van was temporarily being stationed in a graveyard close to the old branch, as the bank has been unable to find anywhere else to park the vehicle for free.

In another blow to those relying on face-to-face banking, a growing number of some of the best easy-access savings accounts no longer come with branch access – leaving customers with no choice but to sign up online.

According to data firm Moneyfacts 40pc of accounts no longer offer branch access. This has risen from 33pc in the past five years, and is up from 29pc a decade ago.

Lloyds said visits to its banking van service had fallen by 90pc since 2018, helping just 14 customers on average per location. Some locations, it said, had as little as two customers visit.

Sam Richardson, Deputy Editor of Which? Money, said: “While the decision to shut any form of bank branch is a commercial one for individual firms to take, Lloyds’ decision is particularly disappointing given these vans were meant to serve rural areas with limited branch coverage.

“It highlights why we need strong regulator involvement, to ensure that alternatives such as shared banking hubs are more quickly rolled out, and then properly maintained.”

A Lloyds spokesman said: “Customers have used our mobile branches much less over time and some locations now have as little as two customers using the service.

“We’ll be introducing more community bankers, alongside the other options customers already have for their banking including the Post Office, online, our mobile apps, phone banking, video services and web chat.”

Once all previously announced closures are complete, Lloyds said it will have 1,061 branches – 515 under Lloyds Bank, 413 under Halifax, and 133 under Bank of Scotland."
Savings passbooks popular as Britain turns to cash amid cost of living crisis,"While some banks are scrapping passbook savings accounts amid suggestions they are past their sell-by date, other providers have reported an increase in their usage as people turn to cash to help them manage the cost of living.

Newcastle building society said that in 2023 it issued about three times as many passbooks as it did in 2021, and that it is getting new customers on the back of decisions by rivals to axe them.

Meanwhile, Yorkshire building society has issued research showing that while passbooks might be associated with older savers, more than a quarter of those aged 18 to 34 have one.

Savings passbooks – which record the money paid in and withdrawn, plus interest earned – have been around for generations.

They first appeared during the 18th century, and at one time, millions of people held popular passbook accounts such as Liquid Gold, an account offered by Leeds Permanent building society (later swallowed up by the Halifax) and promoted in the 1980s by TV adverts featuring the wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley from the TV series Minder.

However, as online banking took off, many savings providers stopped offering them.

At Lloyds Banking Group (which includes Halifax), new passbooks have not been available to customers since 2015.

Related: Slash your overdraft costs and get ‘free’ cash: how to get your bank and savings into shape

It is understood to be withdrawing more than 3m passbooks, the bulk of which involve Halifax accounts – including Liquid Gold, plus others such as Monthly Saver and Passbook Saver.

A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said it started talking to customers last year to help them get familiar with how accounts operate without passbooks, then wrote to people between the end of October and mid-December to give them two months’ notice of the change.

Virgin Money told us it was in the process of removing passbook accounts from its range. This means that about 100,000 people will no longer be able to use them to pay in or withdraw cash. The bank has indicated that affected customers can typically keep the account they have and operate it as a statement-based account instead of using a physical passbook.

Nationwide no longer offers new passbook accounts.

It would appear that some of those having their passbooks taken away are crossing the road and signing up with a rival bank or – more likely – building society that still has them.

Michael Conville, the chief customer officer at Newcastle building society, said: “We’ve seen where banks on our high streets have either closed or stopped offering savings passbooks, new customers will join the society because they know we’re committed to offering both digital and in-person financial services.”

Almost six in 10 of the society’s members hold an account with a passbook or passcard, and it is seeing almost half a million transactions a year across its 31 branches.

The Newcastle said: “The greater trend has been toward our members making deposits [using a passbook or passcard] rather than an increase in withdrawals.”

This week, Yorkshire building society said its data showed that 550,000 of its members used passbooks for their savings accounts at a branch last year.

The cost of living crisis has prompted many people to turn back to “tangible” physical money to help them budget, the banking body UK Finance said in September.

Similarly, the accountancy firm KPMG said last year that Britons were turning to bank branches to help them manage their rising living costs, adding that “depositing and withdrawing cash [were the] key drivers for visiting a branch more often”.

All of the Newcastle’s branch-based savings accounts offer passbooks. They include Newcastle Double Access Saver (Issue 3), which pays 4.5% interest if two or fewer withdrawals are made in a year (the rate is 2.9% for three or more withdrawals), and Newcastle Easy Saver (Issue 5), which pays 3%.

Yorkshire building society accounts that come with passbooks include Rainy Day Account Issue 2, paying up to 5%, and Access Saver Plus Issue 7, which pays 3.45%."
"Lloyds to cut 1,600 jobs across branches in shift to online banking","Lloyds Banking Group is planning to cut 1,600 staff from its branch network as it tries to reduce costs and push customers towards digital services as part of a corporate overhaul.

The UK company said it was adapting to a shift in behaviour, with more than 21 million of its 26 million customers choosing to use its services online.

But the job cuts are likely to raise concerns for the 8% of Lloyds customers – about 2 million – who exclusively rely on going into branches to manage their accounts.

The bank will simultaneously create 830 jobs in its relationship growth team – amounting to an overall reduction of about 769 jobs – to provide a hybrid service of in-branch, video or phone appointments for customers. However, there is no guarantee that those new roles will be given to staff whose jobs are being cut.

Lloyds is closing about 114 branches this year, leaving a network of 1,061 sites. The staff cuts will be aimed at senior branch workers, with Lloyds maintaining its most junior roles.

The staff union, Accord, hopes most of the cuts will be on a voluntary redundancy basis, where workers ask to leave and receive some compensation, though it is likely to be offered only in some cases.

In November, Lloyds confirmed plans to slash nearly 3,000 roles from the wider business – excluding its branches – focusing on middle-management roles including analyst and product management posts. Again, the bank said it was creating thousands of positions that would ultimately result in a net 120 roles being added to its workforce.

The job cuts are part of a £3bn overhaul announced under the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, in early 2022 in an attempt to push further into digital banking, bulk up the corporate bank and wealth division, and strengthen Lloyds’ position as a UK landowner.

Commenting on the latest round of job losses, a Lloyds spokesperson said: “As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it is important our people are available when it matters most. We are introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to.”

Accord said: “LBG announced significant changes to its branch network structure and ways of working, which it says are necessary because of changes in customer behaviour. The move represents a significant change to the branch networks and our members.”"
"Former bank manager stands to scoop $637,000 settlement after being fired for using the N-word in an anti-racism class","A bank manager who was fired when he used the N-word in an anti-racism seminar has received up to £500,000 ($637,000) in damages after judges ruled he acted without malice and used the word as a result of his dyslexia.

Carl Borg-Neal was sacked by the British bank Lloyds in 2021 after upsetting an instructor when he used the offensive slur during an online class discussing race in the workplace.

Lloyds ‘went too far’
The offending statement took place during a segment of the class that examined intent versus effect in racially charged language, according to a published ruling.

Borg-Neal had asked the trainer of the class how he should handle a situation when someone from an ethnic minority uses a word that might be considered offensive if used by someone not within that minority.

When the instructor didn’t respond, Borg-Neal followed up by saying: “The most common example being use of the N-word in the Black community.” However, he used the full word rather than the abbreviation.

Lloyds accepted that Borg-Neal acted without malice, had apologized immediately after using the word, and that the question was fair, but determined he should have known better than to use the slur in a professional environment.

The trainer of the seminar also took several days off following the incident, encouraging Lloyds to take its decision to dismiss the manager.

Last year, an employment tribunal ruled that Lloyds went too far when it decided to fire Borg-Neal for using the slur and that it didn’t need to dismiss him to show its stance on offensive language.

“If the bank wanted to make a point, it could have given the claimant a warning and more training, as he suggested himself,” the tribunal wrote.

The tribunal added that Borg-Neal’s dyslexia can “lead him to keep reformulating questions and to ‘spurt’ things out before he loses his train of thought.”

He now stands to receive up to $637,000 in damages, his lawyers told Bloomberg, after the tribunal said he faces several obstacles to returning to work following the dismissal, particularly his need to recover from an anxiety and depressive disorder he developed as a result of the incident.

The damages include past and future loss of earnings, injury to feelings and personal injury, as well as interest fees.

It is more than half the £1.2 million ($1.5 million) Borg-Neal sought to retrieve after winning his unfair dismissal claim last October.

While Lloyds initially challenged the tribunal’s decision, a spokesperson for the bank told Fortune it now accepts the ruling.

Middle-aged white men are ‘bottom of everything’
Borg-Neal has consistently said he wanted to keep his job at Lloyds, telling The Telegraph he would have accepted a pay cut or a demotion rather than being dismissed and branded a racist.

“The impact on the claimant was enormous,” the tribunal wrote. “He lost a job where he had found he could excel with his dyslexia. The impact on the claimant was enormous.”

However, while it agreed that Borg-Neal was dismissed unfairly and faced disability discrimination, the tribunal rejected Borg-Neal’s claim that he was discriminated against based on race when he was fired.

The tribunal said it didn’t believe “any substantial part of the dismissal was that the claimant was white.”

But Borg-Neal, who is a local councillor for the U.K. Conservative Party, is still suggesting his race was behind his dismissal at the bank.

“I often wonder if I wasn’t a white middle-aged male would I have had to go through everything I went through,” Borg-Neal told The Telegraph in an interview last week.

“There is no way of telling. But when I talk to my friends—and as you can imagine a good many are white, middle-aged, and male—we all agree that is the worst thing you can be right now. You are bottom of everything.”

Borg-Neal’s lawyers didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

U.K. banks are increasingly finding themselves at the center of political furors tied to a growing culture war in the country.

In July, NatWest Bank was engulfed in a crisis after closing a bank account belonging to Nigel Farage, an ally of Donald Trump and former leader of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party (UKIP).

Farage was initially told his account with sister bank Coutts was closed for “commercial reasons” after his balance fell below £1 million, the minimum to hold an account at the bank.

However, it later emerged that Farage’s account was closed because his views didn’t align with the bank’s."
Barclay family repays £1.2bn debt to Lloyds amid potential sale of Telegraph,"The Barclay family has repaid the nearly £1.2 billion that it owed to Lloyds Bank, opening up its chance to transfer control of the Telegraph newspaper to an Abu Dhabi-backed fund.

However, the Government has launched a probe into the proposed takeover of the newspaper and fellow publication The Spectator by the fund, amid concerns over the security and free speech implications.

Lloyds confirmed that it had received the money on Monday, after seizing control of Telegraph Media Group in June over the unpaid debt.

It then tried to sell the newspaper group and the Spectator, which are both read closely by Conservative Party politicians and supporters.

Daily Telegraph potential sale

Lloyds said the debt of Penultimate Investments Holding Limited (PIHL), the holding company, had been repaid and the titles have been removed from receivership.

“We can confirm the repayment of the PIHL facilities has now completed,” it said.

“We are always keen to work constructively with customers who get into difficulty with their repayments to reach an amicable solution.

“We’d like to thank all parties for their role in reaching this point.”

The Barclays had last month reached a deal with RedBird IMI to get help to pay back the debts. RedBird IMI would then take over control of the newspaper group.

RedBird IMI is led by the former boss of CNN, Jeff Zucker. It is part owned by US firm RedBird Capital.

But it is the other joint owner, International Media Investments of Abu Dhabi, which has worried the Government.

IMI is part of a sovereign wealth fund linked to Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the royal family in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Last week the Culture Secretary, Lucy Frazer, asked watchdog Ofcom to launch a probe into whether the sale to RedBird IMI would impact the accurate presentation of news and freedom of expression in the Telegraph titles.

Ms Frazer said “there may be public interest considerations” with the change of ownership which “warrant further investigation”.

The regulator has until January 26 next year to report back to the minister.

RedBird IMI said that it would “co-operate fully with the Government and regulator”."
Lloyds chief swings the axe as honeymoon period ends,"Charlie Nunn spent last week bouncing from an investment summit with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, to a high-powered London bank conference and then jetting off to Cop28 in Dubai.

Yet amid the glad-handing, the Lloyds Bank boss still found time for the more mundane parts of the job.

On Tuesday afternoon, he could be found sitting in a drab office guiding City analysts through a set of plans to boost Lloyds’ corporate business.

Nunn, who has led the group for two years, is trying to build momentum for a turnaround plan now entering its crucial phase.

The 52-year old took the reins from Antonio Horta-Osorio, the man credited with saving Lloyds from the brink during the financial crisis before hatching the goal of “helping Britain prosper”.

Now, Nunn must convince the City he has the plan for the next decade.

After a year aided by rising interest rates that have given the lender a fair wind at its back, 2024 is set to be tougher. Interest rates may well start to fall and higher wage inflation kicks in. Nunn must pick up the pace of change.

“We’re very much into the execution part now,” says Benjamin Toms, an RBC Capital Markets analyst who follows the bank. “At the beginning they went a bit slower and now they’re probably going a bit faster.”

Quickening can be seen in news that Lloyds plans to axe as many as 2,800 middle manager roles as part of an overhaul, which also includes shutting 45 Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland branches.

Nunn will shuffle most staff affected by the middle management cuts into new roles focusing on digital.

Still, the plan has prompted disquiet from unions. Lloyds workers’ largest trade union, Accord, said it would fight any job losses and push to make sure people who are moved are properly trained for their digital roles.

Nunn, a former HSBC executive who spent time at McKinsey, first laid out his plans to transform Lloyds in February 2022, saying he wanted the bank to move beyond its core business of savings and mortgage lending and develop new revenue streams.

Acquisitions of vehicle leasing business Tusker and funds platform Embark have given the bank a funnel of new customers, and there is speculation that Lloyds could swoop for Tesco Bank’s five million customers.

Nunn wants Lloyds to start cross-selling more of these sorts of products to its existing 30 million customers. Lucrative wealth management and pension products are high on the list.

Investor reaction to the strategy has so far been somewhat tepid. Lloyds’ share price is near enough where it was on the day Nunn started, with the stock moved more by economic factors than corporate ones.

Some of Lloyds’ top shareholders are fully behind him, even if the payoff is yet to come.

David Samra, managing director of Artisan Partners International Value Team, one of the bank’s largest US shareholders with a $650m (£514m) stake, told The Telegraph: “We think the share price should be double where it is.

“The strategy to reinvest back into business to develop products and services that they can sell to their customers that generates fees is the right thing to do.

“The outcome, despite management’s enthusiasm, is yet to become visible. But the objective is correct.”

For it to be a success, Nunn will have to overcome the bank’s poor track record of cross-selling. Lloyds tried to pull off a similar move in the late 90s with a £7bn deal to buy mutual Scottish Widows, which offers pensions and life insurance, but the benefits were never fully realised.

“Lloyds has tried to sell wealth management products to UK consumers for 30 years and it’s never worked before,” says Ed Firth, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Firth, who has covered banks for nearly 25 years, said the wealth management strategy was undermined by Lloyds paying just 1.4pc on its easy-access savings account when rates were 5.25pc.

“How do you expect your customers to trust you with wealth management products? I think Charlie instinctively would agree but I don’t think he’s actually managed to change the culture at Lloyds,” he says.

Lloyds disputed that customers get poor value on their products, pointing to savings products that offer up to 4.2pc with instant access. A spokesman said the bank had increased rates on 15 occasions alone this year.

Ultimately, Firth believes “the wealth management strategy stuff is a distraction”.

“I would like to see a braver recognition of the real challenges and how he plans to address them,” he says.

The rise of more nimble digitally focused lenders such as Monzo, Starling and Chase means there are more sweeping challenges on the horizon. Firth believes a key priority must be to build a cloud-based computer system that the bank can run on, allowing it to be nimbler.

Still, Cambridge-educated Nunn, who picked up £3.7m last year, has more time to show his strategy is paying off.

He is liked in the City, in no small part because of his focus on costs. Lloyds has one of the best cost-to-income ratios of all the big banks.

“In a commodity business like banking, you need to be low cost, and the focus on cost again is the exact right thing to do,” says Samra at Artisan Partners International Value Team.

“We like the management and the chairman of the board. We think they’re all excellent people.”

Despite some reservations, Firth also believes Nunn is a “breath of fresh air” compared to other bank bosses.

“Most of the banks, all they’re talking about is share buybacks and return on equity targets whereas you can actually get Charlie to talk about what customers are looking for and what they need.”

Lloyds is still making healthy profits and solid revenues.

However, despite the positive numbers, shares are still down 7pc this year and it trades at a discount to book value.

Taken one way, it could be interpreted as a poor report card for Nunn. However, Samra argues it is more to do with the regulatory straightjacket placed on banks.

“A regulatory balance needs to be achieved,” he says. “I applaud a lot of the regulation that has come in since the financial crisis but you can’t do that forever.

“Whatever profits banks can generate never make it back into the hands of the shareholders. As a result, you end up with these discounted valuations.”

Nunn himself last week warned politicians off a windfall tax on bank profits, no doubt with one eye on the possibility of an incoming Labour government. The Lloyds said there was “nervousness” among international investors about backing UK banks.

Lloyds has a policy of buying back about £2bn of its shares each year but the lender has an additional £2.5bn of excess capital it could choose to hand back, according to Jefferies.

The complex sale of Telegraph Media Group could also help Lloyds recoup its £1.16bn loan to the Barclay family, opening up the possibility of a special dividend.

However, cash handouts can only work for so long. Ultimately, Nunn must show that his vision for how to run the core business is the right one.

Toms at RBC Capital Markets says: “We’re starting to see some green shoots come through. Lloyds has invested at the right time.”

Like a gardener sowing seeds in winter, Nunn, his shareholders and the City at large are waiting for the flowers to bloom.

A Lloyds spokesman said: “To achieve the ambitious strategy we launched in February 2022 and to meet our customers’ evolving needs, we are transforming our business.

Oil price falls after Saudi-led cartel surprises market,"The price of crude oil fell after a cartel of oil-producing nations led by Saudi Arabia surprised the market by issuing a statement that failed to include an expected pledge to cut production by another million barrels per day.

Brent crude, which is used to price the sale of two-thirds of the world’s oil, had climbed by 5.1pc over the last three days to more than $84 (£66) a barrel in the run up to Thursday’s meeting of the Opec+ group of 23 oil-exporting countries.

The online gathering of producers aimed to prop up the declining price of oil and has ended with an agreement to cut output by at least another one million barrels per day by early next year.

Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the group, has already been cutting supply by a million barrels a day since the summer and will extend the time period of these cuts as well.

But Brent Oil fell after the Opec+ meeting issued a statement that avoided a united commitment to cuts in production. The price is down 2.47pc on yesterday.

Oil prices had fallen 8pc this month before its recent rally amid concerns about global demand next year and as the Israel-Hamas war failed to impact supplies.

The meeting had originally been scheduled for Sunday but was delayed after disagreements from some of the alliance’s smaller nations over their contributions to the cuts.

The Opec+ group pumps more than 40pc of the world’s oil, meaning cuts to supply potentially have huge implications for petrol prices.

In related news, Opec+ announced that major oil producer Brazil will join the group from January. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said: “Considering that Brazil is a large oil producer and is driving oil production growth it is important to have them on board, but it seems that they are not cutting production like Mexico.”"
"Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland to shut another 45 branches","Lloyds Banking Group is shutting another 45 branches across its network and the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands amid the ongoing shift away from high street banking.

The group is closing 22 Halifax branches, 19 Lloyds branches and four in the Bank of Scotland business.

Lloyds stressed that all affected branch staff will be offered other roles at another branch or in a different part of the business, with no compulsory redundancies planned.

It comes just a week after NatWest Group said it plans to shut another 19 branches, mostly in the early part of next year.

The latest closures take the total number of high street branches shut across the sector to 623 so far this year.

Lloyds is set to close the bulk of the branches in March and April next year, with some also closing in August and a tranche in November.

It means that at least 276 branches will be shut across Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland this year and next.

The closures announced will leave the group with 515 Lloyds Bank branches, 413 Halifax and 133 Bank of Scotland sites.

There has been a massive exodus of branches from the high street in recent years.

The largest number of closures announced this year have been Barclays branches, with the bank saying 185 of its sites are set to shut.

Lloyds is second with 131, followed by NatWest with 116, Halifax with 94, Virgin Money with 40, Bank of Scotland with 32, Ulster Bank with 10, TSB with nine, Royal Bank of Scotland with five, and one Nationwide branch.

A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman said: “The way customers choose to bank with us has changed rapidly in recent years, and we now offer a wide range of options for their everyday banking needs.

“This includes our mobile app, online and over the phone.

“Customers can also bank with us through the Post Office, in a Banking Hub, or by speaking to a Community Banker.”

Consumer group Which? said banking customers are being “left on a cliff-edge” by the swathes of banking closures and called for a faster rollout of community banking hubs.

Jenny Ross, Which? money editor, said: “These closures are yet another nail in the coffin for the UK’s high street banking infrastructure and will see some towns lose more than one bank within a matter of days or weeks – suggesting little thought has been given to the impact on the communities they serve.

“With more than 170 branches already due to close in 2024, on top of the 5,783 branches that have closed since January 2015, consumers are being left on a cliff-edge as in-person banking services are axed from their communities.”

She added: “Banking hubs could play an important role in this, but the rollout is taking far too long and more hubs must open as soon as possible to stop millions of consumers being left behind.”"
Lloyds chief urges UK policymakers to keep their hands off banks’ profits,"The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group has fired a warning shot at UK policymakers, saying measures such as a windfall tax on banks should be ruled out before what is expected to be a hard-fought election year.

With Labour largely silent on its plans for City regulation despite its current commanding lead in the polls, Charlie Nunn said City firms and investors alike were “looking for more certainty and clarity around the future”.

His comments appear to be a call for assurances that the UK will not follow some European governments, which have put new taxes on banks accused of reaping billions in extra profit from rising interest rates over the past year.

Nunn urged policymakers to keep their hands off profits, dividend payments to shareholders and the amount of interest paid to lenders that park cash at the Bank of England.

“With respect to financial services, the nervousness is the narrative around what we saw in Spain and Italy and Switzerland around windfall taxes, or reserve remuneration, or withholding dividends,” he told the FT’s global banking summit in London on Tuesday.

“The real desire that we would have – and that I know our shareholders would have – is just clarity that banks can continue to operate effectively in supporting their customers, and can continue to safely create returns for their shareholders,” he said.

Nunn’s comments came after Italy shocked markets by announcing a 40% windfall tax on banks in August, in a move that sent shares in local lenders plunging. It followed similar policies introduced in the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Spain, which have taken aim at banks profits that have soared in line with rising interest rates.

Higher rates have allowed lenders to increase the amount they charge borrowers for loans and mortgages, which have often risen faster than the returns offered to savers. Lenders have pocketed the difference, known as the net interest margin – which is a key measure of their profitability.

It has sparked criticism from UK MPs on the Treasury committee, who accused lenders in July of profiteering during the cost of living crisis. The committee reiterated its concerns last month, and criticised the largest UK banks for being too slow to reward savers after HSBC more than doubled its profits and handed out $3bn (£2.5bn) to shareholders.

The campaign group Positive Money has said that a UK windfall tax could have already raised £3.4bn from the UK operations of the country’s big four banks – Lloyds, NatWest, Barclays and HSBC – based on the profits earned in the first half of 2023 alone.

Debate has also swirled around the amount of interest that banks such as Lloyds earn for placing their cash at the central bank in the form of reserves.

Swiss policymakers took decisive action on the issue last month, announcing they would no longer make payouts to commercial lenders on the minimum sums they are meant to hold in reserves at the central bank in an effort to cut costs.

Nunn’s warnings, however, are likely to be closely followed by Labour and Tory politicians as they attempt to woo City firms and garner business support ahead of a likely election in 2024.

Nunn said policymakers needed to boost UK’s international credibility and attract investors who might otherwise be wary of betting on Britain, particularly in the wake of Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget last year.

“We just want a level playing field relative to other international markets and relative to the dynamics domestically,” he said.

He welcomed the Conservative government’s attempt to overhaul City regulations though a package of changes known as the Edinburgh Reforms, but he said the City needed to be able to rely on longer-term support.

“What we need to do is build momentum and support … through whatever the political cycle is, because directionally they are positive and supportive of investing more in the UK, using bank and insurance balance sheets more efficiently and supporting customers in a more proactive stance.

“And that, to me, is the most important thing that comes out of this next decade: that we give the big financial institutions in the UK the confidence to start innovating again on behalf of their customers.”"
"UPDATE 2-Britain's Lloyds shake-up puts around 2,500 jobs at risk - source","Britain's biggest high street bank Lloyds is putting around 2,500 jobs at risk as part of a shake-up, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid a renewed push by lenders to slash costs.

Lloyds is poised to begin a consultation with staff in a number of roles, including analysts and product managers, the source said, adding many would go through a selection process and it was unclear how many would ultimately be cut.

Staff are expected to be informed of the process as early as next week, the source said, adding it would also involve the creation of 120 roles.

The Guardian first reported on the process.

""We are evolving and transforming our business to ensure we can do more for our customers and deliver the products and services they need,"" a Lloyds spokesperson said, adding the bank was reviewing how teams worked without elaborating on potential cuts.

The news comes after Reuters reported on Thursday that Lloyds' rival Barclays is working on plans to save up to 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion), which could involve cutting as many as 2,000 jobs.

Most British banks have reported a run of strong profits as higher rates lifted lending revenue. But investor concerns about tougher competition for savers' cash and potential loan defaults amid a cost-of-living crisis are weighing on the sector.

"More than 2,500 jobs at risk in Lloyds shake-up","More than 2,500 jobs are at risk at Lloyds Banking Group, which is poised to become the latest financial institution to announce cost cuts, the Guardian can reveal.

Britain’s largest high street lender is understood to be considering axing a series of middle-management roles including analyst and product management posts as part of a consultation that is expected to be shared with staff next week.

The latest announcement, which follows reports that up to 2,000 jobs could go at Barclays, will raise fears of mass job losses in the City. So far, most redundancies in the sector have been confined to highly paid bankers, including Goldman Sachs letting thousands go earlier this year. UBS is in the process of merging with Credit Suisse, which is also expected to lead to a reduced headcount.

Sources inside Lloyds indicated that, while 2,500 roles are being reviewed – equivalent to one in 20 of the total – management hope the number lost will end up being lower. A source familiar with the consultation said the bank expected to create a net 120 UK jobs at the end of the process, but was changing the focus of certain roles.

City sources said that the move by the group, widely seen as a barometer for UK economic health, is a sign of its £4.5m-a-year boss Charlie Nunn’s “no-nonsense approach”.

A month ago Lloyds reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, with pre-tax profits rising to £1.9bn.

It and other banks have benefited from the recent 14 consecutive Bank of England interest rate rises, which enabled them to make money on the difference between what they charge borrowers and savers. However, now that rate rises appear to have reached a plateau this “net interest margin” has begun to fall, raising concerns about a squeeze on future income.

Lloyds warned in its latest results that mortgage lending was also proving challenging given tougher conditions in the housing market as a result of higher borrowing costs. Lloyds shares are down 10% this year and the bank is now valued at £27bn.

Lloyds and Halifax announced branch closures earlier this year, affecting 40 sites, adding to an industry tally of more than 200 branches shutting.

The reports that Barclays has begun working on plans to cut 1,500 to 2,000 jobs in a £1bn cost-cutting drive come weeks after the bank’s bosses warned of the need to restructure to boost profits and dividend payments to shareholders.

The shake-up is expected to affect mainly back office jobs in departments such as compliance, human resources and legal, according to a source cited by Reuters.

The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said in his autumn statement on Wednesday that the government would explore options for selling off its remaining 38.6% stake in the high-street lender NatWest Group, with the public probably to be offered the chance to buy shares. Lloyds was previously part owned by the taxpayer, but the government sold its last shares in 2017.

A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: “We are evolving our business to ensure we can do more for our customers and deliver the products and services they need. To achieve this, we’re delivering one of the largest transformations in UK financial services which includes reviewing how our business and technology teams work together effectively to deliver on our strategy and long-term growth.”"
Culture Secretary minded to intervene in Abu Dhabi’s Telegraph takeover,"The Culture Secretary has told Lloyds Banking Group that she is minded to intervene to safeguard press freedom as it seeks to complete a £1.2bn debt repayment deal that would hand control of The Telegraph to a fund backed by Abu Dhabi.

Lucy Frazer has written to Lloyds, the Barclay family and RedBird IMI signalling that she will issue a Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN) that would prompt regulators to investigate. She asked for more information about the complex arrangements and gave the parties until 3pm on Thursday to respond to her concerns.

The Barclay family are attempting to repay £1.2bn in overdue loans to Lloyds with new lending mostly sourced from Abu Dhabi royalty. RedBird IMI, a media investment fund, would be the vehicle for £600m of the total and would seek to immediately convert its loan into ownership of The Telegraph.

The Barclay family lost control of The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine in June. It has agreed new loans backed by Manchester City owner and UAE vice-president Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. Redbird IMI is mostly funded by him and his business in Abu Dhabi would provide the balance of the debt directly to the Barclay family.

Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative Party leader, said: “Of number one importance is editorial independence of The Telegraph, which is absolutely critical. It is one of our oldest newspapers and a significant newspaper of record. Many will be concerned at the thought that it could be handed over to a foreign government.”

Ms Frazer has said she is minded to intervene in the deal despite allegations of threats by Lloyds.

The bank’s chief corporate affairs officer Andrew Walton warned officials in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) that using powers to protect the public interest in free expression risked angering Lloyds’s powerful shareholders.

Sources close to the discussions on Monday said the comments were interpreted as a threat, an interpretation Mr Walton rejected.

He said: “We made abundantly clear to the Government the significant implications to us and to our shareholders of a PIIN at this stage. It was not a threat but it was a very clear warning.”

Lloyds is lobbying hard for the PIIN to address only the conversion of the RedBird IMI loan into shares and not the overall debt repayment plan.

The bank fears that a broad investigation would mean the funds are not delivered to the Barclay family in time for a court hearing in the British Virgin Islands on December 4.

If the December 4 hearing goes ahead, a crucial entity in the chain of ownership would be liquidated and there would be no prospect of a full repayment of the £1.2bn debt.

In that scenario, Lloyds would be forced to restart an auction that was paused on Tuesday after its dealings with the Barclay family angered bidders including a consortium led by Sir Paul Marshall, the publisher of The Daily Mail and National World, a local newspaper group.

Mr Walton and his colleagues are instead lobbying for the debt repayment to be allowed to go through. They want Ms Frazer to trigger an investigation only into the second stage of the plan, the conversion of RedBird IMI’s loan into shares in The Telegraph. The fund has said it would cooperate with such a probe and that it would protect The Telegraph’s independence.

The conversion of the RedBird IMI loan into Telegraph ownership is planned for as soon as possible after the debt is repaid. An investigation of this stage alone could leave The Telegraph in regulatory limbo for several months, technically owned by the Barclay family but with rules in place to prevent them making changes to its operations.

If RedBird IMI’s Abu Dhabi links ultimately prompt Ms Frazer to block a takeover, there would be further uncertainty over ownership.

A spokesman for RedBird IMI said: “We welcome the opportunity to make further representations to the Government, restating that if we gain ownership of the Telegraph and Spectator we will be fully committed to maintaining the existing editorial team of the publications and believe that editorial independence for these titles is essential to protecting their reputation and credibility.”

The Barclay family said they would “continue to engage constructively with the Government on this matter”.

A Labour spokesman said it recognised “the public interest concerns raised over the planned acquisition of The Telegraph Media Group”.

They added: “Britain has a strong and independent free press. It’s important that every necessary step is taken to preserve it and our democracy.”"
Ministers ‘should halt Abu Dhabi takeover of The Telegraph’,"Ministers should intervene to protect press freedom and prevent £1.2bn in loans to the Barclay family turning into an Abu Dhabi takeover of The Telegraph, lawyers for the hedge fund chief Sir Paul Marshall have said.

In a letter to a consortium led by Sir Paul, which had been bidding for ownership in a competitive auction, legal advisers White & Case said there were grounds for the Culture Secretary, Lucy Frazer, to prevent the Gulf-backed deal being completed within weeks.

Ms Frazer is minded to issue a Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN) and could do so as soon as this week, Sky News reported last night.

A PIIN triggers investigations by Ofcom and potentially the Competition and Markets Authority.

White & Case argued that Ms Frazer would be justified in also issuing a “hold-separate” order to prevent RedBird IMI, an Abu-Dhabi-backed investment fund converting its loan to the Barclay family debt into ownership of The Telegraph.

The memo, seen by The Telegraph, said: “We consider it reasonable and justified for the Secretary of State to issue a PIIN immediately… [and] to impose an order that at the very least prevents RedBird IMI from exercising its option to acquire ownership and/or control over The Telegraph and The Spectator.

“This is especially justifiable given the opacity by which the Barclays and RedBird IMI have sought to explain the arrangements.”

Lloyds Banking Group has halted the auction of The Telegraph after RedBird IMI agreed to help fund full repayment of the Barclay family’s £1.2bn debt with new loans.

The bank said the competitive process run by Goldman Sachs would be suspended until 4 December while it scrutinises the family’s offer to repay its borrowing. A parallel auction of The Spectator magazine has also been stopped.

Sources said Lloyds had been left with little choice but to pause the auctions after its dealings with the Barclay family angered bidders. As well as Sir Paul’s consortium they included the Daily Mail publisher DMGT and National World, a local newspaper group.

There is mounting concern in Westminster over the prospect of an undemocratic foreign state gaining majority control of an influential news publisher.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman insisted that press freedom was “vitally important” at a Downing Street briefing with journalists.

He said: “It’s a crucial part of democracy that the Prime Minister has talked about previously, and will continue to support.”

Rishi Sunak is scheduled to visit the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in early December for the COP28 climate conference. Next week representatives of the Arab absolute monarchy are expected in London at the Government’s Global Investment Summit.

Following a private meeting today, the Commons culture committee vowed to look at “foreign state ownership” of media and other British cultural assets and commissioned officials to work up options for further inquiry.

Dame Caroline Dinenage, Conservative chairman of the committee, told The Telegraph: “The potential foreign state ownership of a British newspaper title raises important concerns.

“While it is not for the committee to review the details of this case, we will want to consider the wider implications about foreign state ownership of media, culture and sport institutions and will return to the issue shortly.”

Lloyds seized control of Telegraph and The Spectator in June by sending in receivers, after losing patience with the Barclays years after repayment had been due. In the following months the family made a series of offers to cover part of what they owed, until last week when they made an offer for the full amount. If the offer clears regulatory hurdles Lloyds would be obliged to end the receivership and return the titles into Barclay family ownership.

However, the deal would be funded by two complicated loans, one of which would be provided by the investment fund RedBird IMI and would immediately convert to ownership of The Telegraph.

RedBird IMI is a joint venture between the US private equity firm RedBird Capital and International Media Investments (IMI), a venture backed by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, vice-president of the UAE and owner of Manchester City. Abu Dhabi cash would account for most of the £600m price.

IMI would directly loan the balance of debt to Lloyds to the Barclay family, and take security over their other business interests. They include the online retailer Very, formerly known as Littlewoods.

David Davis, the senior Conservative MP and former Brexit Secretary, said: “There are clear public-interest concerns with an investment in a major UK newspaper, like The Telegraph, by a company reportedly owned by the vice-president of the UAE.

“It is clear the regulatory authorities need to look very carefully into this before considering any approval.”

RedBird IMI, led from New York by the former CNN chief Jeff Zucker, has said that transfer of ownership would be subject to regulatory review with which it would fully cooperate.

It said: “RedBird IMI are entirely committed to maintaining the existing editorial team of the Telegraph and Spectator publications and believe that editorial independence for these titles is essential to protecting their reputation and credibility.”

Lloyds bank is scrutinising the Barclay family’s repayment offer under anti-money-laundering and so-called Know Your Client regulations before a British Virgin Islands court hearing early next month."
Abu Dhabi-backed fund poised for Telegraph takeover,"An investment fund backed by Abu Dhabi has confirmed plans to take ownership of The Telegraph “at an early opportunity” as MPs on the culture select committee urgently discuss the implications for press freedom.

RedBird IMI, led by the former CNN chief Jeff Zucker and mostly funded by Abu Dhabi royalty, is in line to take control of The Telegraph within weeks as part of its efforts to build an international media empire.

A spokesman said: “Any transfer of ownership will of course be subject to regulatory review and we will continue to cooperate fully with the Government and the regulator.”

It added that The Telegraph’s operations will be solely managed by RedBird Capital, Abu Dhabi’s US private equity partner in RedBird IMI, distancing editorial matters from the Gulf state.

The spokesman continued: “International Media Investments [Abu Dhabi] will be a passive investor only.”

“RedBird IMI are entirely committed to maintaining the existing editorial team of the Telegraph and Spectator publications, and believe that editorial independence for these titles is essential to protecting their reputation and credibility.

“We are excited by the opportunity to support the titles’ existing management to expand the reach of the titles in the UK, the US and other English-speaking countries.”

The fund is also bidding in an £1bn auction of Britain’s biggest independent television producer, All3media, the maker of the BBC reality show The Traitors, The Telegraph can reveal. All3media declined to comment.

RedBird IMI is seeking to gain ownership of The Telegraph as soon as mid-December by helping to finance a £1.2bn debt repayment from the Barclay family to Lloyds Banking Group. The bank took control of The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine in June by sending in receivers following a protracted dispute over unpaid debts and interest.

RedBird IMI will provide the family with a £600m loan tied to a 12-month option to convert the lending to shares. Abu Dhabi would provide funding to repay the balance of the debt directly to the Barclay family, secured against their other businesses including the online retailer Very.

Lloyds is currently assessing whether the repayment offer clears compliance hurdles in relation to anti-money laundering and so-called Know Your Client regulations. If no problems are found it is legally obliged to return The Telegraph and The Spectator to the Barclay family, regardless of their plans to effectively sell the assets on.

RedBird IMI said it will call in its option on The Telegraph “at an early opportunity”, interpreted by insiders as almost immediately after Lloyds has assessed the offer and accepted payment.

MPs on the Commons culture committee are expected to hold private talks over the planned transaction on Tuesday, amid calls for it to be investigated as a potential threat to free expression and even national security.

Dame Caroline Dinenage, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: “This is a complex and confusing situation - it’s important that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport scrutinises the financing and ownership of any deal closely.”

The committee has powers to launch inquiries, call witnesses and seek answers from officials. The Culture Secretary, Lucy Frazer, has a crucial role to play in scrutiny, with powers to intervene to protect the public interest in free expression.

She recently told media executives: “My priority, and that of this Government, will always be standing right behind our media and protecting freedom of the press at every turn.”

The prospect of a fund majority-backed by an autocratic Arab state owning an influential news publisher has sparked concern both outside and inside The Telegraph.

More than half a dozen Conservative MPs have already called for official investigations of the transaction, with Dame Caroline’s comments the latest sign of anxiety. The Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and security minister Tom Tugendhat, who both attend Cabinet, have privately voiced concerns.

In a note to newsroom staff on Monday Chris Evans, editor of The Telegraph, said: “You’ve been asking me how we can be confident that editorial independence would be protected. At the moment I know no more than you will have read. For now, we must continue with our work.”

While Lloyds scrutinises the Barclay family offer for two weeks, a separate auction of The Telegraph managed by Goldman Sachs and an associated transfer of the business into a new and unencumbered company are continuing. Bidders including a consortium led by the hedge fund boss Sir Paul Marshall and the publisher of The Daily Mail, among others, have been urged to submit their first-round bids by 28 November.

A spokesman for the Barclay family declined to comment."
Fund backed by Abu Dhabi in line to own The Telegraph within weeks,"The Abu Dhabi-backed investment fund RedBird IMI is in line to take control of The Telegraph within weeks in a deal that is causing concern among Conservative MPs.

RedBird IMI would serve as a conduit for a £1.2bn loan, mostly provided by the Emirati royal and Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which would allow the Barclay family to repay in full a debt to Lloyds Banking Group.

It is understood that almost as soon as that deal is completed, the loan would be converted to shares, making RedBird IMI owner of The Telegraph.

Lloyds seized control of The Telegraph in June by sending in receivers after losing patience with the Barclay family over long standing debts. The family made an offer to repay their owings in full with backing from RedBird IMI last week, threatening to derail an ongoing auction process that has attracted interest from the hedge fund chief Sir Paul Marshall and Daily Mail publisher DMGT, among others.

On Sunday, Lloyds was still assessing the Barclay family offer. However, sources indicated that it was likely to be satisfied that legitimate funds were in place to complete repayment.

That could mean RedBird IMI, which is led by the veteran American television news executive Jeff Zucker, would be in control of The Telegraph as soon as mid-December following a two-week due diligence process where Lloyds is being advised by Lazard.

Nevertheless, the rival investment bank Goldman Sachs is continuing to run the auction process, in which first-round bids are expected by the end of the month.

The perception that an influential news publisher would be under the effective control of a foreign power has alarmed some Conservative MPs. Calls for the potential transaction to be scrutinised have increased, with senior ministers under pressure to assess its impact both on the public interest in free expression and on national security.

A letter signed by the senior Tories Sir Edward Leigh, Sir John Hayes and Baroness Margaret Eaton has urged the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, the Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and the Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to intervene.

The MPs wrote: “Material influence over a quality national newspaper being passed to a foreign ruler at any time should raise concerns, but given the current geopolitical context, such a deal must be investigated.”

There was “a strong case for close scrutiny by the government under both the Enterprise Act 2002 and the National Security & Investment Act 2021”, they wrote, highlighting questions over the hefty price that RedBird IMI appeared willing to pay. Analysts have valued The Telegraph at about half the value of the loan the Abu-Dhabi-backed fund is preparing to make to the Barclay family.

Potential bidders in the auction of The Telegraph were warned by Lloyds representatives that not more than 25pc cash from the Gulf would be allowed to fund any deal. It is understood that about four fifths of the Barclay family’s £1.2bn debt repayment would come from Abu Dhabi.

The National Security & Investment Act 2021 grants ministers sweeping powers to block takeovers and financing transactions that are judged to threaten national security.

RedBird IMI has appointed lobbyists to argue its case, which is likely to emphasise the scale of existing Abu Dhabi investment in the UK. In late 2021 the Government claimed a £10bn foreign direct investment coup in a deal with Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund.

Spokesmen for Lloyds, the Barclay family and RedBird IMI declined to comment."
Barclay family bid to regain control of The Telegraph with Gulf cash,"The Barclay family have made an offer to repay in full a £1.2bn debt to Lloyds Banking Group and reassume control of The Telegraph in a potential deal backed by Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed.

RedBird IMI, a media investment vehicle led by the former CNN chief Jeff Zucker and partly funded by Sheikh Mansour, has agreed to lend the Barclay family the full sum. There would be no direct investment in the deal from the Abu Dhabi royal family.

The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine are currently controlled by Lloyds after it sent in receivers in June to recover a longstanding debt which had been secured against them. Repayment of the debt in line with terms issued to a Barclay family holding company in the British Virgin Islands would end the receivership and deliver the titles back under Barclay family control.

It is understood that RedBird IMI is not in line to take any shares in The Telegraph under the initial terms of the new loan. It was not clear what conditions do apply, including what security over the assets will be taken and whether the debt might be converted to equity in time.

Such details are likely to be at the centre of any debate over whether repayment of the Lloyds debt with a loan from RedBird IMI should trigger regulatory scrutiny. A figure of £1.2bn is double the top end of what analysts forecast that The Telegraph would fetch on the open market.

A source familiar with RedBird IMI said: “Jeff Zucker is a serious figure and of course people will assume he’s going to be involved in the business. They are investors for growth and have been looking for media assets with global potential.”

However it is understood there are no plans for RedBird IMI to take seats on the board of The Telegraph.

Mr Zucker resigned from CNN last year after failing to disclose a relationship with a marketing executive at the channel. After a long stint at NBC, which is viewed as leaning to the left of US politics, he led CNN to success with combative coverage of Donald Trump’s candidacy and presidency.

The Barclay family’s Zucker-backed offer threatens to derail an ongoing auction of The Telegraph being run by Goldman Sachs. Bidders including a consortium led by the hedge fund chief Sir Paul Marshall, the Daily Mail publisher DMGT and local newspaper group National World have lined up to bid.

Lloyds has signalled in that process that no more than 25pc of the ultimate purchase price may be funded by investment from the Middle East, owing to the risk it would trigger lengthy regulatory reviews of the impact new owners might have on the public interests in free expression.

At more than 25pc a Gulf owner could also trigger the National Security and Investment Act, which hands the Government sweeping powers to block takeovers.

The Conservative backbencher Danny Kruger, an ally of Sir Paul, has argued in a letter to the Culture Secretary that the Barclay family’s plans to tap Gulf investment to repay the debt to Lloyds raises similar concerns.

Mr Kruger wrote: “If material influence over, or control of, a quality national newspaper was passed to an unknown foreign ruler at any time it would raise concerns, but at a heightened time of geopolitical turmoil I believe it is more important than ever that this deal for a treasured national asset is given proper scrutiny.”

Mr Kruger questioned why “the amount of the loan… is far beyond what The Telegraph and The Spectator could commercially support”. It is understood the loan payments would be made from across the Barclay family’s businesses.

Conservative MP Neil O’Brien, who left the Government in this week’s reshuffle, today echoed those concerns.

He said: “The Telegraph & Spectator are two of our most prestigious publications. Naturally there’s interest from around the world in gaining control of them. I hope [the Department of Culture, Media and Sport] will scrutinise the financing and ownership structure of any deal closely.”

The Barclay family have argued there is no basis or precedent for a public interest intervention in a debt transaction.

Their latest offer comes days before a hearing in the British Virgin Islands on Monday at which Lloyds was preparing to re-petition to liquidate Penultimate Investments Holding Company, which is thought to be a keystone of their business empire.

As well as The Telegraph and The Spectator, the Lloyds debt was secured against the online retailer Very and courier Yodel, but they remain under family control.

Lloyds is now considering the offer and seeking more information about the source of the money and how it would be delivered. The auction process continues, with first round bids expected by the end of the month.

Fears for the future of the business have been heightened after Lloyds took the unusual step of telling some customers they would be switched to online statements without explaining the reason for the move.

“We’ve moved your statements from post to paper-free,” some customers were told in a letter earlier this month.

Lloyds said the changes would take place from the beginning of November. “We’re experiencing some issues and may not be able to send as many by post as we normally do,” the letter went on.

Lloyds, which currently owns The Telegraph but has no involvement in editorial matters, has already led one survival plan including a two-part “Interim Funding Agreement”, totalling £13m, that other major banks took part in.

Regulatory rules require banks to provide paper statements “or in another durable medium” if a customer requests one. Yet, demand for paper statements is falling sharply. The most recent accounts for Communisis, for 2021, detailed a 20pc decline in its core printing business due to the ongoing switch to digital communications.

Communisis was plunged into crisis when its American parent OSG Holdings declared bankruptcy after racking up large losses in recent years.

It was the second time in 14 months that the company had sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The first occasion allowed it to trim $134m (£110m) of debts from a balance sheet weighed down total borrowings of $824m.

It posted losses of nearly £25m in 2021 and £39.8m the year before.

Communisis was approached for comment. Lloyds declined to comment."
"As Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) advances 4.6% this past week, investors may now be noticing the company's five-year earnings growth","The main aim of stock picking is to find the market-beating stocks. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON:LLOY), since the last five years saw the share price fall 28%.

Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline.

Check out our latest analysis for Lloyds Banking Group

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

While the share price declined over five years, Lloyds Banking Group actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 12% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.

Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.

We note that the dividend has fallen in the last five years, so that may have contributed to the share price decline.

We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Lloyds Banking Group

What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Lloyds Banking Group the TSR over the last 5 years was -13%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective
We're pleased to report that Lloyds Banking Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.1% over one year. That's including the dividend. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 3% per year over five years. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Lloyds Banking Group (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable) that you should be aware of.

Savers have been denied interest worth hundreds of pounds – is your bank paying fair?,"Britain’s biggest banks have only passed on half of interest rate rises to savers in the past year, analysis has found.

The average easy-access savings rate offered by big banks increased by 1.56 percentage points between October 2022 and 2023, according to Which?, the consumer group.

This is despite the Bank of England increasing the Bank Rate by 3 percentage points over the same period.

Banks continue to shortchange savers despite pressure from the Chancellor, City watchdog and MPs.

Big banks paid an average of 1.98pc at the beginning of last month, even though the Bank Rate reached 5.25pc.

It means a saver with £20,000 in an account paying 1.98pc will earn £396 a year, compared with £1,050 if banks had fully passed on rate rises – a difference of £654.

Lloyds, Halifax, Barclays and HSBC paid less than 2pc on their easy-access accounts during the same period. Lloyds offered returns of 1.4pc, while Halifax and Barclays had rates of 1.5pc and 1.65pc respectively.

Which? said most high street banks have failed to make substantial improvements to easy-access rates since the City watchdog set out an action plan for cash savings in July.

The Chancellor said in June that banks were “taking too long” to reward savers with higher rates, adding: “It’s an issue that needs to be resolved.”


Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said it has “challenged” some of the worst offenders who failed to increase returns fairly or did so with a long delay compared to increases to mortgage rates.

The Treasury Select Committee also wrote to the heads of Britain’s biggest banks to raise its concerns as parts of its investigation into banks’ savings rates.

Between July and October the average easy-access rate across the market rose from 2.41pc to 3.16 – a 0.75 point rise – but among the biggest banks only Barclays and Ulster Bank made larger improvements.

Jenny Ross, editor of Which? Money, said that despite MPs and the regulator “repeatedly raising the alarm over meagre savings rates”, big banks “aren’t getting the memo”.

She said: “It’s crucial that anyone fortunate enough to be able to put money aside during a cost of living crisis is getting the best returns possible. Once again, it’s challenger firms and building societies that lead the way.

“Firms must act urgently to improve their rates or face tough action from the regulator by the end of the year.”

The FCA’s Consumer Duty rules, which came into force over the summer, mean firms need to review their products and demonstrate they offer fair value.

Challenger banks have gone to greater lengths, raising rates by 2.31 points, from 1pc to 3.31pc.

Among one-year fixed rate deals, the average rate offered by the major banks has risen by 3.45 points, but none were among the top rates available.

The high street banks analysed were Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Santander, The Co-operative Bank and Ulster Bank.

Lloyds, Halifax, Barclays and HSBC were contacted for comment.

Banks’ performance in dealing with APP scam victims revealed by regulator,"A regulator has revealed the performance of individual banks in tackling authorised push payment (APP) scams and how they treated those who fell victim in 2022.

To help improve transparency for consumers, the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) collected data from banks on reimbursement to victims.

Significantly, there are currently inconsistent outcomes for customers who report an APP scam to their bank or building society, the regulator said.

For example, it said some automatically reimburse in full, others may only make a partial reimbursement, leaving victims to bear part of the loss, and others will only accept claims subject to very narrow circumstances.

?? We have published our first APP scams performance report.

Consumers can now see the full extent of how well their bank has been tackling APP fraud and how they treated victims in the last year, compared to other UK payment firms. ??https://t.co/eZE2o4ITSk pic.twitter.com/hOoV5gJTAe

— PSR (@ThePSR) October 31, 2023

The PSR said that, by the volume of cases, where there was full reimbursement, TSB fully reimbursed 94% of the APP scam cases reported to it.

It was followed by Nationwide, which fully reimbursed 91% of cases, and Barclays, which fully reimbursed in 79% of cases.

The PSR said 6% of cases reported to Monzo were fully reimbursed, while Danske Bank fully reimbursed 7%.

The PSR warned that TSB was unable to separate out Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) reimbursements from its data, causing its reimbursement statistic to be overstated, although it said this is not likely to have any material effect on its ranking.

The regulator also looked at which banks and payment firms held accounts that received the highest value of APP fraud per million pounds of transactions.

The top firms in the research with the highest account receiving fraud rate included Metro Bank, Starling, TSB and Monzo.

For every £1 million received into Metro Bank accounts in 2022, £696 of it was APP fraud, the regulator said.

For TSB, for every £1 million received, £605 of it was APP fraud. For Starling it was £307 in every £1 million, and for every £1 million received in a Monzo account, £227 was from an APP fraud.

The PSR said that, by contrast, for every £1 million received by Santander accounts, only £44 was from APP fraud.

Chris Hemsley, managing director of the PSR said of the new data: “This represents a substantial improvement in transparency. This provides better information for customers on how firms handle APP fraud and encourages these firms to take more action to tackle it.

“Our approach is working because we know there is a greater focus across many more firms on preventing fraud. Our commitment to transparency and the forthcoming mandatory rules are key to strengthening efforts to prevent these frauds from happening in the first place.

“Over the coming months, we will be bringing all payment firms into new reimbursement arrangements to give more consistent protection across the board. This is important because we can see from today’s report that this has not always been the case.”

Currently, many banks are signed up to a voluntary reimbursement code, but there have been concerns that it is not always interpreted consistently. Some providers, such as TSB, operate their own guarantees around reimbursement.

Mandatory reimbursement requirements are due to be put in place for victims of APP scams in 2024. The new measures will also see both sending and receiving firms often being held equally liable for reimbursing victims of APP fraud.

The report covered the period January 1 2022 to December 31 2022 and The report focused on Faster Payments because it is the most frequently used way that fraudsters carry out an APP scam, the PSR said.

Although payments resulting from APP fraud represented less than 0.1% of overall Faster Payments volumes in 2022, Faster Payments were used for 98% of APP fraud payments.

Payment firms will be required to publish the information on their websites within 20 days, which will give consumers greater transparency, the regulator said.

It will continue to collect data from payment firms over the next 12 months and will publish a report for 2023 next year.

It is also working with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to identify where action is needed and will set out plans for payment firms to make improvements.

A statement from trade association UK Finance, which represents banks and other financial firms, said: “The financial services sector invests more in countering fraud than anyone else, and is the only sector that reimburses victims – even though the vast majority of authorised fraud originates on other platforms and networks.

“Our latest fraud report shows that the majority of authorised push payment fraud is reimbursed, with over £152 million returned to victims in the first half of this year alone.

“What today’s data from the PSR does not show is where fraud starts. Our data shows that 94% of authorised fraud starts online or over the phone, through social media, fake messages and more.

“But the technology and telecommunications sectors bear no responsibility for reimbursing victims, which means there is little commercial incentive for them to truly tackle the enormous threat that continues to proliferate on their platforms and networks.

“While you can reimburse money, you cannot reimburse the emotional and psychological impact that fraud has on victims. We need these sectors to do more with us to protect consumers by preventing these awful crimes from happening in the first place.”

Sheldon Mills, executive director, consumers and competition at the FCA, said: “Fraud and scams can destroy lives and have a devastating effect on victims. The PSR’s data is an insight into the scale and challenge of tackling APP fraud and we welcome the upcoming rule changes that will see more people get their money back.

“Firms must protect their customers from fraud. We are currently undertaking a review of firms’ anti-fraud measures and we are following up where we have concerns.”"
10 Best European Bank Stocks To Invest In,"In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best European bank stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of one of the most rapidly changing industries these days, then take a look at the 5 Best European Bank Stocks To Invest In.

Comparing the importance of industries before and after the coronavirus pandemic, the macroeconomic shifts ushered in by the virus have made banking today quite different when compared to the pre COVID-19 era. Before the virus struck, banks could charge low interest rates for all types of loans, whether for everyday consumers in the form of short term credit card lending or longer term mega financing for real estate projects. Now, with the benchmark rate in the U.S. sitting at 5.25%, all kinds of debt have become quite expensive; however, bank revenues are also higher as they are able to earn more on an existing portfolio of loan assets.

The link between the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate that the central bank officials meet regularly to decide, and the everyday consumer using their credit card to buy gas, is due to lending within the banking system. Banks, especially big banks, maintain liquidity for consumer loans by either using their own funds or by borrowing money from each other. The interest rate that a bank can charge for these loans is the Federal Funds Rate, so since all consumer credit purchases are financed by money that the lending bank will recover at a later date, the bank makes credit card payments on the consumer's behalf by either its own cash assets or through arranging from other banks.

As an illustration of this principle, consider the profits of the five largest American Banks by assets as of March 2023. The trailing twelve month revenue of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) are $154 billion, $101 billion, $79 billion, $81 billion, and $45 billion. Comparing these to the figures for 2019, the last pre COVID-19 year the in the industry, these mark an average growth of 16.6%, as only Wells Fargo is the only major American bank whose revenue is down from 2019.

This revenue growth is coming during a time when the cost of consumer credit has significantly increased. The average APR for all new credit card offers in the U.S. is 24.46% according to LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ:TREE). While credit card lending has always had high APRs for the riskiest customers, the data from the online lending marketplace shows that when compared to 2019, the percentage of credit card customers who were charged higher APRs has grown to 35% from 2% in 2019.

These trends are not limited to the U.S. Instead, they extend to all developed economies. The cost of borrowing in the European Union according to data from the European Central Bank shows that whether it's revolving loans, overdrafts, or extended credit card credit, interest rates are at their highest since 2009. Back then, the borrowing cost that includes both corporate and consumer loans stood at 5.08%, and as of October 2023, this sits at 4.97%. Comparing the revenues of the biggest banks in Europe to the latest values and their readings in 2019, all of them, including big ticket names such as UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS), Banco Santander, S.A. (NYSE:SAN), and Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS), have demonstrated growth.

Therefore, it's clear that rapid interest rate hikes make today's banking quite important for corporate and consumer well being, and even though the high rates offer lucrative profit opportunities, the turmoil that they create in the money markets is risky. These risks came to light in the form of the banking crisis in the U.S. in March 2023 as well as mega property bond defaults in Europe, along with Europe's biggest banking story that started from the turmoil of the 167 year old Swiss Bank Credit Suisse.

With bank revenues soaring and their loans becoming riskier, we decided to take a look at the best European bank stocks to buy. Some top picks in the list are Janus Henderson Group plc (NYSE:JHG), UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS), and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE:DB).

"UK consumers ‘adjusting to the times’, Lloyds says as its earnings grow","UK consumers are “adjusting to the times we’re in”, Lloyds Banking Group has said as it reported rising profits on the back of higher borrowing costs.

The banking giant, which also owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland, said its banking and mortgage customers are proving to be resilient in the face of higher living costs.

Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of £1.9 billion for the three months to September, beating analysts’ expectations and more than tripling the revised £576 million made last year.

The lender took in £3.4 billion in net interest income – the difference between what it paid out for deposits and generated from loans – which was up on the year before.

It comes as higher interest rates, which currently stand at 5.25%, have pushed up the cost of borrowing.

Lloyds maintained there has been little sign of stress among its borrowers, with arrears relatively stable and defaults on loan repayments slowing, although remaining slightly above pre-pandemic levels.

Its mortgage borrowers typically have a lower loan-to-value deal and a higher income, meaning they are more able to absorb higher interest rates, the bank has previously said.

Loan balances grew by £1.4 billion in the latest quarter, although lending fell by £2.8 billion over the first nine months of the year.

Meanwhile, household spending increased in recent months despite consumers facing a cost-of-living squeeze, the bank revealed.

Lloyds and Halifax branch closures
Lloyds said more customers were moving money from current accounts and into savings (Stefan Rousseau/PA)
William Chalmers, Lloyds’ chief financial officer, said: “You can see some pretty consistent and reasonable spend increases – it’s interesting, in our base, that is strongly in both travel and entertainment, as examples.

“So, not just the staples, but also customers choosing to spend money on discretionary uses too.

“I think it’s safe to say that, as a general matter, customers are adjusting to the times that we’re in.”

Furthermore, the finance boss said the banking group has seen more of its customers locking cash away into savings accounts to make the most of higher rates.

Some £3.2 billion was taken out of current account deposits and £3.9 billion put into savings.


More than two-thirds of the money flowing out of current accounts, which typically have low returns, is “captured” by Lloyds’ savings accounts, Mr Chalmers said.

A more competitive savings and mortgage market helped drive a slowdown in the bank’s net interest margin in the latest quarter, compared to the three months to June, as it paid out more to savers and generated less from borrowers.

It comes after rival bank Barclays saw its share price tumble on Monday after cutting its forecast for net interest margin and seeing UK deposits fall by 6%, amid greater competition in the savings market.

Meanwhile, the bank cautioned that UK house prices are expected to fall throughout 2024 and not begin to recover until 2025, as higher rates continue to take a toll on demand for housing.

It also forecast that the unemployment rate could peak at levels above 5% in 2025, and stay elevated until at least 2027."
Lloyds Bank profit surges on higher borrowing costs,"Lloyds Banking Group’s profit has leapt higher as the UK’s biggest mortgage lender continued to benefit from higher borrowing costs.

The banking giant, which also owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland, reported a pre-tax profit of £1.9 billion for the three months to September, up from a revised £576 million this time last year and slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations.


The lender took in £3.4 billion in net interest income, up on the year before.

However, it recorded a slight slowdown in its net interest margin in the latest quarter, compared with the three months to June, as it took in less cash from loans and paid out more to savers.

Lloyds said it had seen a shift in customer deposits, with more people moving cash out of current accounts and into savings, which typically give savers higher returns.

Some £3.2 billion was taken out of current account deposits and £3.9 billion put into savings, the bank revealed.


Group chief executive Charlie Nunn said: “Guided by our purpose, we remain focused on supporting our customers and helping them navigate the uncertain economic environment.

“The group continues to perform well. Robust financial performance and strong capital generation in the first nine months of the year was driven by net income growth, cost discipline and resilient asset quality. This performance allows us to reaffirm our 2023 guidance.”"
Lloyds bank closure made cancelling housebound husband’s standing order a real trial,"My 93-year-old husband and I have separate bank accounts, and neither of us uses online banking. All the banks in our town have closed, and the nearest branch is in Penzance, 10 miles away. My husband, a painter, became suddenly housebound over the summer and therefore needed to cancel the standing order for payments for the studio he rented. I had to go to Lloyds in Penzance with a signed letter authorising me to cancel the standing order and inviting staff to call him to verify it.

Staff then told me that because my husband had banked with Lloyds for so long, there was no record of his signature on its system and they could not, therefore, cancel the standing order. I was told to do it over the phone and was given the number for a department that deals with vulnerable customers.

When I called, a recorded voice announced that this facility had now closed. It didn’t provide an alternative. I therefore had to return to Penzance the following day and another member of staff got permission from the manager to cancel the standing order. It was obvious that she was making a special exception in my case. It has left me feeling very frightened at the way banks are dealing with customers who can no longer travel to one of their branches.
JA, St Ives, Cornwall

Your story illustrates the human cost of branch closures. And that cost is rising. Your local Lloyds shut up shop three years ago, and Lloyds will close another 23 premises over the next year. Barclays plans to axe 146, a third of its entire UK network. The rationale is to cut costs and coax customers online. But millions of older, poorer and vulnerable people are unable to use the internet.

A recent survey by campaign group Which? found that 52% of respondents with disabilities struggled to access banking facilities since their local branch vanished. Banks have a legal duty to perform rigorous security checks to protect customers from fraud, but without a physical presence on the high street, they must find flexible ways of accommodating customers who can’t travel.

Some are failing to do so. Last month, a bed-bound Santander customer faced having to hire a private ambulance to attend his nearest branch on a stretcher after staff insisted he present in person to complete an online payment.

Lloyds tells me that before a branch closes, it informs customers of alternative options and employs a specialist call centre team, community bankers based in local community hubs and “consumer treatment officers” to provide local support. Except, of course, the number for the specialist team had been withdrawn, there is only one Lloyds community bank in Cornwall, 16 miles from you, and the obliging but invisible treatment officers were not mentioned.

Lloyds says it would give you a call to discuss options when I made contact. In the meantime, you and your husband have opened a joint account with another bank, also, sadly, requiring that same 20-mile round trip.

SM from Doncaster is not a vulnerable customer; she just happens to be on sabbatical in Europe. That was of no consequence to Barclays when it questioned a money transfer that she had attempted. It blocked her card and insisted she visit a branch in the UK for extra security checks. “I have no access to my money and will have to spend large sums and several days travelling to the UK and back,” she writes.

It was right and proper of Barclays to question an unusual transaction and intervene when a telephone security check failed. However, it was entirely unreasonable to expect SM to cross a continent to unfreeze her account. Under the new Consumer Duty introduced by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, banks must respond flexibly to individual circumstances.

When I put this to Barclays, it called SM, ran through extra security questions and unblocked the account. Which is what it should have done in the first place.

The bank blames a “slight miscommunication” during the initial security questions for locking SM out of her account for seven days. It says an alternative solution, such as video banking, should then have been offered and has paid £50 in goodwill for the inconvenience. It says: “If a customer fails our security checks and we have concerns of account take over, we may ask them to come into one of our branches or Barclays local community sites to verify their identity. We recognise that, on this occasion, we could have provided a better service to our customer.”

John Lewis service on the right wavelength
I wanted to share an outstanding experience with John Lewis. A radio I’d bought 15 months ago stopped working. The receipt gave a number to ring with any problems and the call was answered immediately by a knowledgable lady, who quickly agreed a replacement. It arrived the next day. Moreover, as the price had been reduced I was refunded the £40 difference.

Murdoch lines up bid for The Telegraph,"Rupert Murdoch has lined up to bid for The Telegraph in an auction launched on Friday by its temporary owner Lloyds Banking Group.

The nonagenarian media mogul is among a dozen prospective bidders in a sale that is expected to reshape the news industry in the UK and internationally. They have been contacted by the auctioneers, Goldman Sachs, with confirmation of the formal launch of the process.

Mr Murdoch’s British publisher News UK has registered interest in bidding despite the widespread assumption that an attempt to bring The Telegraph under the same control as The Times and The Sun would be blocked by regulators.

However, Westminster sources speculated that the digital revolution in news and its distribution could prompt fresh thinking on how competition and plurality are assessed.

The last time it carried out analysis, in 2019, Ofcom found that The Telegraph and News UK account for 26.5pc of national newspaper consumption online and in print. On that basis a Murdoch takeover of The Telegraph would create a combination slightly larger than DMGT, the publisher of The Daily Mail and Mailonline, on 25.4pc of weekly readership.

The regulatory hurdles likely to be faced by a News UK bid for The Telegraph are expected to prompt concern that it could merely be seeking to gather intelligence on a rival or disrupt the sale. Sources said the bank will assess the credibility of all bidders before granting them access to detailed financial information.

It is understood News UK is managing its interest in the process in-house and has not appointed investment banking advisers. News UK declined to comment on the auction, which comes close to the end of Mr Murdoch’s long career on the front lines of the media industry.

The 92-year-old is scheduled to step down as executive chairman of his companies at the end of the year and hand over to his eldest son Lachlan. This week an activist investor called for the break-up of the empire. Mr Murdoch Sr has plenty of history with The Telegraph, including launching multiple price wars against it.

Lloyds is also selling The Spectator magazine, which Mr Murdoch has also registered interest in acquiring via a separate auction. After a flurry of initial interest it has attracted fewer prospective bidders than The Telegraph.

First round bidding for The Telegraph is scheduled to begin in a fortnight and last four weeks. A second round with a smaller field is expected to open after Christmas, with the auction likely to conclude in early February.

Alongside Mr Murdoch, the auction is expected to pit the hedge fund bosses Sir Paul Marshall and Ken Griffin against a consortium led by the former Telegraph editor Sir William Lewis. DMGT has signed up to bid, as has the German publishing giant Axel Springer.

The Czech gas tycoon and West Ham Utd investor Daniel Kretinsky is expected to participate in the auction, as well as the local newspaper group National World and Belgian publisher Mediahuis. A handful of private equity firms have registered interest and may seek to provide capital to the winning bidder.

Multiple suitors are understood to be focused on The Telegraph’s potential for international growth, particularly in the United States where there is a perceived gap in the news market on the centre-right. The details of such investment plans are likely to play a significant role in how bids are judged, alongside price and regulatory concerns.

Lloyds seized control of The Telegraph in June. The bank sent in receivers from AlixPartners following a dispute with their previous owners, the Barclay family, over debts of more than £1bn secured against them. A new board led by chairman Mike McTighe was appointed at the parent company, Press Acquisitions Limited, and is managing the auction.

The Barclay family have sought to derail the sale in recent days with a £1bn offer to settle the debt, backed by undisclosed Abu Dhabi investors. Lloyds has rejected the approach and made legal moves to distance The Telegraph from its former owners and any further wrangling ahead of the sale.

It is understood that the Barclay family have been told that they may compete in the auction should they wish. However, their other businesses, including the online retailer Very, are also linked to disputed debts to Lloyds.

Valuations for The Telegraph have varied from as low as £300m to as high as £1bn, in part because sales of significant national news organisations are rare and they carry a trophy premium which is difficult to predict. The Telegraph last changed hands in 2004 for £665m.

In a message to staff, Telegraph Media Group chief executive Nick Hugh said: “No doubt there will be a great deal of speculation in the months ahead as prospective bidders come forward, but for us it remains business as usual.”

Lloyds will attempt to recoup as much of the debt as possible while securing new ownership for The Telegraph which is readily acceptable to regulators and the Government. Potential buyers will face scrutiny over the impact a deal would have on competition and the public interest in media plurality and free expression.

It is understood that Lloyds is only likely to consider bids dependent on less than 25pc money from Gulf investors. At that level, sweeping ministerial powers to delay or block a sale under the National Security and Investment Act would be triggered.

Lloyds is seeking a swift and uncomplicated sale. Ownership of an influential news publisher as a general election looms is said to be uncomfortable for Britain’s biggest high street bank.

This week The Telegraph published independently verified subscription figures for the quarter to September. They showed a 5pc increase in digital subscriptions and a total including print of 1,012,631."
Lloyds transfers Telegraph ownership to new company as auction looms,"Lloyds Banking Group is to transfer The Telegraph to a newly established holding company as it prepares for an auction and a potential legal battle with former owners the Barclay family.

Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited was registered on Companies House on Monday as a subsidiary of Telegraph Media Group Limited, which publishes The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph, and all their digital properties.

Ownership of the assets is to be shifted to the new vehicle in a form of restructuring known as a hive down. Telegraph Media Group Limited and dormant companies associated with it will be dissolved. It is understood that the process will have no impact on staff pay, benefits or conditions.

A source said: “This is an administrative change as part of the sale readiness process.”

As well as simplifying the corporate and legal backdrop to a sale, the moves will be seen as intended to ring-fence The Telegraph from any potential court wrangling with the Barclay family that might overshadow the imminent auction.

The Barclay family owned The Telegraph from 2004 until this summer, when a long-running dispute over debts of more than £1bn prompted Lloyds to appoint receivers.

The bank, an arm of which made massive loans to the Barclays before the financial crisis, is also taking action offshore as it seeks to further distance The Telegraph from their complicated web of holdings. It has applied to a court in the British Virgin Islands to dissolve Penultimate Investment Holdings Limited Group, a company further up the chain of ownership.

The restructuring is among the hurdles Lloyds is racing to clear before the formal start of an auction of The Telegraph. The so-called teaser documents, which set out the investment opportunity for bidders, are currently expected to be distributed next week, although the complexity of the situation has previously slowed progress.

The Barclay family have made a series of offers to pay off some of the debt they secured against The Telegraph in hope of regaining control. The latest was valued at £1bn and backed by Abu Dhabi investors.

Lloyds has so far been unmoved by the family’s representations and is pressing ahead with plans for a competitive auction run by Goldman Sachs.

A spokesman for the Barclay family said: “The family continues to work on finding a mutually acceptable resolution with Lloyds Banking Group regarding the media assets.”

The Barclays have endured family and financial upheaval in recent years. A bugging scandal prompted by a succession dispute, an acrimonious divorce for 88-year-old Sir Frederick Barclay and steep business challenges have exposed them to public scrutiny they sought for decades to avoid.

The Barclays’ attempts to regain control of The Telegraph come alongside talks over the future of the biggest business, the online retailer and consumer credit provider Very, which is also linked to significant debts to Lloyds.

The bank has signalled that as well as price, it will judge bids for The Telegraph on how likely they are to avoid regulatory investigations. Such action on grounds of competition, plurality or free expression would mean months of delays.

Suitors have lined up including Sir Paul Marshall, the co-owner of GB News, who has formed a consortium with fellow hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, a major donor to the US Republican party. Daniel Kretinsky, the Czech billionaire gas dealer and West Ham United investor, has registered an interest. Sir William Lewis, a former editor of The Telegraph, is gathering another consortium.

Newspaper groups including the German giant Axel Springer and Lord Rothermere’s DMGT, the publisher of The Daily Mail, are also expected to bid. The conflict in Israel and Gaza may have complicated matters for DMGT, however.

It has been in talks with Qatari investors to boost its financial firepower in the auction. The tiny Gulf state has come under criticism from senior Conservatives in recent days for its links to the Hamas terror group."
Nigel Farage to bank with Lloyds after Coutts account closure,"Nigel Farage will start banking with Lloyds after the controversial closure of his Coutts account.

The former UK Independence Party leader said on Friday he was relieved to have been offered an account by Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage provider, after he was rejected by a string of other high street lenders because of his political views.

It comes after his accounts with Coutts were closed over the summer after staff decided his views did not “align” with the bank’s own values “as an inclusive organisation”.

When the row went public, it triggered a furore that led to the resignation of Dame Alison Rose as chief executive of NatWest, which owns Coutts.

An official inquiry into debanking was also launched.

Mr Farage, who is a presenter for television channel GB News, said his offer from Lloyds, which was first reported by Sky News, came after “big name” high street lenders had turned him down in recent months.


He told the The Telegraph: “Lloyds Bank has offered me banking facilities and I have to say, having been rejected by 10 banks, it is just nice to know that there is a high street lender that doesn’t suffer from political prejudice.

“I have spent countless hours on phone calls and in face-to-face meetings and there was a point where I really thought nobody would bank me at all – I tried everyone.

“So I now understand what so many other people and businesses have been through in the last few years. It is astonishing.”

Lloyds currently owns The Telegraph following a dispute with the Barclay family, who owned it for almost two decades. The bank has no involvement in editorial matters.

A spokesman for Lloyds said: “We do not comment on customer relationships.”

The Financial Conduct Authority last month published its interim findings in a review of debanking after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt demanded that the regulator look into the issue.

But to the dismay of Mr Farage, Conservative MPs and some Government ministers, the City watchdog said it found “no evidence” customers had been debanked for their political views.

This was despite the regulator’s admission that it had not examined Mr Farage’s case at Coutts.

It also did not seek evidence from those who actually claim to have been debanked, relying only on submissions from banks themselves.

Mr Farage added: “I am sorry, but I could give you a dozen members of the House of Lords, right now – or their family members – who have had banking problems, and the same goes for MPs.

“The FCA review has been a complete farce.”

Nikhil Rathi, the FCA’s chief executive, has previously defended the report, stressing that the watchdog is committed to conducting further work on the issue."

Lloyds Banking Group's Improving Profits
Lloyds Banking Group has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future.

Nationwide Building Society launches 8% savings rate and £200 switching offer,"Competition to attract current account holders is heating up, with Britain’s biggest building society launching a £200 switching offer and a linked savings account paying 8% interest.

Nationwide Building Society said the £200 offer is available to people using the Current Account Switch Service (Cass) and transferring a minimum of two active direct debits to the new account.

The offer is available to people switching to one of Nationwide’s three main current accounts – FlexPlus, FlexDirect or the FlexAccount.

It has also introduced a new Flex Regular Saver account, exclusively for current account customers, paying 8% AER (annual equivalent rate) for 12 months.

After a year, the account will revert to an instant access account.

Nationwide has not yet confirmed what interest rate the instant access account will have.

If four or more withdrawals are made from the Flex Regular Saver within 12 months of the account being opened, the rate on the account will fall to 2.15% AER.

According to financial information website Moneyfacts, the last time a cash regular savings account was offering a rate of 8% was a decade ago – in 2013. The fixed-term regular saver was being offered with a rate of 8% by first direct.

Members can save up to £200 per calendar month in Nationwide’s new online-managed savings account, which allows up to three withdrawals within the 12 months after the account is opened.

Tom Riley, director of retail products at Nationwide Building Society, said: “We want to give people every reason to join and stay with Nationwide.

“That’s why we are offering new and existing current account customers a top-of-market £200 if they switch their main banking relationship to the society.

“We’re also rewarding our current account customers with a market-leading rate of 8% AER on our Flex Regular Saver.”

The Flex Regular Saver is only available to members who hold one of Nationwide’s current accounts – FlexPlus, FlexDirect, FlexAccount, FlexStudent, FlexGraduate, FlexBasic or FlexOne.

Members can only open one Flex Regular Saver, either as an individual or a joint account.

Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: “Regular savings accounts work differently to easy access accounts, so it’s important customers read through the account’s criteria to ensure it is right for them.”

She added: “It is great to see Nationwide offering a lucrative £200 free cash offer to entice customers, which could be useful for those looking for a cash boost amid a cost-of-living crisis.

“Nationwide offer some competitive current accounts which have various perks which can suit many different needs.

“Choosing the right current account depends on someone’s spending habits as there are a variety of different accounts out there with their own benefits and charges, so it is worth looking at different options to Nationwide.

“Consumers who are searching for a rewarding bank account may wish to choose one that offers cashback on spending or even on their monthly bills – there are even accounts that pay a monthly reward when certain eligibility criteria is met.

“On the other hand, those consumers who may dip into their overdraft would be better off choosing an account with a competitive overdraft tariff or even an account with an interest-free buffer.

“Those consumers who plan to make frequent trips abroad can also find accounts that don’t charge them for using their debit card in an ATM or in store, so they can avoid paying out on transaction fees compared to a more traditional bank account.

“Switching current accounts is easy to do using the Current Account Switch Service and some banks will pay an upfront free cash incentive to entice customers.

“However, it’s the overall package of an account that should be weighed up before someone commits to switching their current account.”

Earlier this week, Lloyds Bank launched a £175 switcher offer for new customers switching from another bank to a Club Lloyds account before November 14.

There is a £3 monthly fee to maintain the account, waived each month when £2,000 or more is paid in.

Club Lloyds customers can benefit from perks including cinema tickets, a magazine subscription, cashback when shopping at selected retailers, and access to preferential rates when ordering travel money.

Account holders can also access the Club Lloyds Monthly Saver, which pays 6.25% AER and allows customers to save between £25 and £400 each month.

With a further Bank of England base rate rise expected on Thursday, the appetite for saving appears to have grown among some banks’ customers.

NatWest reported on Tuesday that the number of fixed-term accounts opened in the first half of 2023 was around 17 times the total it recorded in the same period in 2019.

More than 82,000 fixed-term savings accounts were opened in the first half of this year, the bank said.

This compares with 4,700 in the first half of 2019, according to NatWest’s data.

TSB also launched a new switching offer on Monday, saying new customers who switch to a TSB Spend & Save or Spend & Save Plus current account can potentially receive over £200, subject to customers fulfilling certain terms and conditions.

New customers using Cass can potentially receive £150 from TSB.

Customers can also potentially earn £10 in cashback each month for the first six months with a Spend & Save account, totalling £60.

For Spend & Save Plus, the same cashback is potentially available for the first six months and then it will revert to £5 cashback a month, totalling £90 in the first 12 months."
U.K. central bank hikes rates to 15-year high amid rising inflation and banking sector impairments,"In an effort to curb soaring inflation, the central bank has escalated its primary interest rate from 0.1% in December 2021 to a 15-year peak of 5.25%. Further, the market anticipates another increase later this week to 5.5%, marking the 14th consecutive rise since August. This series of hikes is causing an uptick in impairments within the British banking sector, as noted by Sam Woods, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England on Tuesday.

Despite these challenges, the economy has shown notable resilience. Woods, who also serves as CEO of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), stated that regulators are vigilantly observing potential strains in the banking sector. He expressed optimism regarding the sector's performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, crediting substantial fiscal and monetary support for safeguarding the banking system from significant credit losses.

However, he acknowledged that impairments across the banking sector are increasing, although he stressed that there is no cause for alarm. The PRA estimates that just over 1% of mortgages are currently in arrears. This figure matches levels seen as recently as 2018 and is significantly lower than during the financial crisis when it peaked at 3.6%.

Woods highlighted that while this figure is rising, it is from a very low base, and regulators are closely monitoring it. He also noted that Britain's smaller banks are over three times better capitalized now than during the financial crisis.

The non-bank financial sector came under scrutiny in September 2022 when the Bank of England intervened to prevent several UK pension funds from collapsing following a plunge in government bond prices and substantial shifts in interest rates. Woods confirmed that the PRA continues to monitor these institutions closely, particularly those with significant exposure to China's property market, which is currently experiencing a slowdown.

This comes in the wake of several small U.S. lenders collapsing earlier this year, which sent shockwaves through the global banking system. Despite these international challenges, Woods emphasized that the British banking sector remains robust and well-capitalized.

Recent sales by insiders

A look at the shareholders of Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON:LLOY) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Lloyds Banking Group.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lloyds Banking Group?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Lloyds Banking Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lloyds Banking Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Lloyds Banking Group. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 5.0% and 4.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.

Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 23 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Lloyds Banking Group
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our information suggests that Lloyds Banking Group plc insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own UK£26m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Lloyds Banking Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Lloyds Banking Group (1 can't be ignored) that you should be aware of.

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.

"UK's Lloyds in talks with Barclay family, Carlyle over Very Group - FT","Britain's Lloyds Banking Group is in talks with the Barclay family and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle over Very Group, an online retailer and financial services provider, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

The British lender holds a guarantee in the overseas holding companies controlling Very Group that is linked to the distressed debt behind the Telegraph, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the discussions.

""The Very Group continues to perform well and is operating as normal with robust liquidity,"" a Very Group spokesperson said in an e-mail.

""We remain fully focused on executing the group’s strategy for continued growth and profitability.""

UK business confidence at 18-month high despite inflation and cost of living crisis,"UK business confidence surged to a 18-month high in August, up 10 points to 41%, despite high inflation and the ongoing cost of living crisis.

According to Lloyds (LLOY.L), it was the highest level of business confidence since February 2022, just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It was also the largest month on month rise since March 2023.

On a regional level, confidence increased across ten of the twelve UK regions and nations, with only Yorkshire & the Humber and the East Midlands reporting lower sentiment.

London, the South East and the South West recorded the biggest monthly increases, as well as having the highest levels of confidence.

The rise in confidence followed a six-point dip in July to 31%, though this level was above the long-term average for the Barometer of 28%.

Business sentiment was largely driven by a more upbeat view of the wider economy, after the latest interest rate rise from the Bank of England (BoE) was a hike of 25 basis points and not the 50 point increase some firms had expected. This led to an overall 15-point rise in economic optimism to 36%, Lloyds revealed.

The survey, which was conducted between August 1 and August 15, had most responses taken after the Threadneedle Street's decision on 3 August.

However, the rise in economic optimism was not consistent among those surveyed last month. Small and mid-sized firms expressed a greater rise in optimism in the economy than larger businesses, reflecting bigger companies’ exposure to global demand.

Manufacturers and large firms with turnover above £25m were more pessimistic about their trading prospects. The former fell 11 points to 35% while the latter similarly decreased 10 points to 48%.

But Lloyds added that trading prospects overall rose for the third month in a row, up two points to 57%. Businesses anticipated stronger activity in the next 12 months, compared with 11% (down two points) expecting weaker outcomes. This results in the net balance increasing four points to 46%, the highest level since December 2017.

Meanwhile, companies hiring intentions rose to a 15-month high, with 50% (up four points), of firms expecting to increase their workforce. In contrast, 18% plan to reduce the number of staff, down three points from the month before.

The August survey also saw some improvement of wage growth expectations, with the proportion of firms expecting higher wage growth remaining elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Firms expecting any increase in the average wage of their employees rose 83% (up three points), the highest since this question began in 2018. Even firms expecting a 3% rise increased to 30% (also up three points), also a record high.

“The bounce in economic optimism this month is the standout point,"" Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.

""Our analysis shows that businesses felt relief that interest rates may be reaching their peak, alongside hopes that measures to tackle inflation are having an impact. With trading prospects remaining stable, and hiring and wage intentions also rising, the macro environment for small businesses and those outside the manufacturing sector is more upbeat.

“From the data, large firms and manufacturers are experiencing some degree of caution, which is likely to reflect the wider global economic environment and, for manufacturing, the rotation of spending towards services.”"
Barclay family launch bid to buy back Telegraph,"The Barclay family have tabled a bid to regain control of Telegraph Media Group from Lloyds Banking Group.

The former owners of the newspaper group, comprising the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph and Telegraph.co.uk, have secured backing from Middle Eastern investors to buy back roughly half the debt it owes Lloyds, Sky News reported.

The unnamed backers are said to be based in Abu Dhabi, while the offer is believed to be in the region of £500m to £600m.
This would mark a significant writeback for Lloyds, which wrote down the value of its loans to the family several years ago.

The Barclays lost control when the newspaper’s parent company was placed into receivership in June.

A formal sale process run by Goldman Sachs is due to begin in September. The Wall Street bank will also auction The Spectator magazine, which was also owned by the Barclay family.

Potential bidders for The Telegraph include Lord Rothermere, the owner of the Daily Mail, who is reportedly courting investors.

Any bid by his company Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), however, would be at risk of a lengthy review of its impact on media plurality that might reduce its attractiveness to Lloyds.

National World, a local newspaper group led by veteran executive David Montgomery, is to date the only party to publicly declare an interest in making a bid.

However, the Barclay family may hope a deal with them would be viewed as preferential by receivers at specialist consultancy AlixPartners, given it would avoid the risk of any protracted regulatory review.

Charlie Nunn, chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, last month said there was “no need to have a rushed sales process”.

He added: “We’ve set up an independent receivership and this is all being managed totally independently from executives at Lloyds Banking Group.

“You can imagine why that’s important for us and for me personally so we aren’t involved in the decision making around how the process is being run.

“We’ve given the receivers the complete freedom to run a process with the right diligence and, from our perspective, to ensure the process is run well from a UK perspective and maximise the returns for our shareholders.”

A spokesman for the Barclay family declined to comment."
Daily Mail owner confirms interest in buying The Telegraph,"The owner of The Daily Mail has confirmed its interest in a takeover of The Telegraph, which is to be put up for sale by Lloyds Banking Group.

The publisher, owned by Jonathan Harmsworth, Lord Rothermere, said on Saturday it had contacted the bank to express interest ahead of an expected auction.

A DMGT spokesman said: “We have been engaged with many parties over the possible synergies between DMG Media and the Daily Telegraph and have registered our interest with Lloyds [Banking Group] but we have no formal plans and there is no consortium.”

This is the first public confirmation of DMGT’s interest in The Telegraph since Lloyds took ownership of the newspaper in June.

It is the second publisher to position itself for a bid after the local newspaper publisher behind The Yorkshire Post, National World, told the stock market last week it was considering participating in the auction, which is expected to begin formally in September.

Given its ownership of other newspapers, DMGT’s takeover of The Telegraph could trigger competition issues. As well as the Mail titles, it owns Metro and the i. Lord Rothermere has been pursuing consolidation as print sales decline and threaten the efficiency of DMGT’s print operation.

Sky News reported that DMGT was seeking partners to help finance a bid. It own finances are being squeezed by the decline of print circulation and advertising, as well as debts taken on to pay for Lord Rothermere’s buyout of other shareholders and delisting of the company from the stock exchange last year.

Lloyds won court approval for the unusual action following a lengthy dispute over debts of more than £1bn which had been secured against the publisher by the Barclay family, its owners since 2004.

Goldman Sachs has been appointed to run an auction of The Telegraph on behalf of Lloyds.

The investment bank will act as lead financial adviser on auctions of The Telegraph and The Spectator, alongside legal advisers from the Magic Circle firm Linklaters. Their appointments were made by the boards of the two parent companies, both of which are chaired by the City veteran Mike McTighe."
Banks profit from mortgage uncertainty as hundreds of thousands put off fixing,"Borrowers paid £1.2bn to some of Britain’s biggest banks in more expensive loans last year over fears of locking into cheaper fixed-rate deals.

Banks have been accused of making large profits off the back of borrowers hesitating to fix their mortgage bills in the hopes rate will come down and opting to temporarily roll on to more expensive variable loans.

Lloyds cashed in the most from customers rolling onto standard variable rates (SVRs) which shot up after the mini-Budget, generating £900m on the highest rate at 8.49pc, according to analysis for The Telegraph by Atom Bank.

This represented 7pc of its revenue and nearly a fifth of its profit after tax. HSBC, NatWest and Santander made a lesser £300m between them, the research found.

Lloyds disputes the figures, which are based on the £30bn SVR balance the bank shared in its financial results for last year.

It comes as banks announce significant profits this year as borrowing costs have risen, with HSBC announcing on Tuesday its pre-tax profits doubled in the first half of 2023.

NatWest’s pre-tax profits have also surged to £3.6bn in the first half of the year, up from £2.6bn in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Lloyds said its pre-tax profits had climbed by 23pc to £3.9bn, and Santander UK’s pre-tax profit jumped 18pc to £1.2bn.

Standard variable rates are the most expensive mortgage rates a borrower can be on and are what people roll onto when they come off their fixed deals.

The current average is around 7.74pc across the Big Six lenders – some 1.34 percentage points more than the average two-year fixed deals across the same lenders, according to comparison site Uswitch.

Data from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) shows 850,000 borrowers rolled onto the variable loans at the end of last year.

While this number has been falling in recent years, the number of borrowers on variable rates in the first half of this year has risen as they hesitate to re-fix in the hope rates will come down again.

Atom Bank has said if a banking customer switched to a more competitive best buy two-year fix product with a 6pc interest rate, they would save £958 a year – shaving 1.91 percentage points off their mortgage rate.

Chief executive of Atom Bank, Mark Mullen, said revenue generated by the big banks from SVRs “is simply the mirror image of profiteering at the expense of savers”.

He added: “They have blamed running costs and GDPR as reasons for not passing on better rates to customers, but have been called out on these excuses by the FCA and the Bank of England.

“Loyalty to your bank is bad for your financial health. We implore borrowers to vote with their feet and shop around for better savings and for better mortgages – it could make a real difference.”

Last week Harriet Baldwin – chairman of the Treasury Committee of MPs – told Britain’s banks the time for “weak excuses” on savings rates was over.

She said: “If the high-street banks continue to pay poor savings rates on their instant-access accounts, they should make sure their customers know that better rates are available.”

Lloyds said Atom Bank’s analysis of its SVR revenue last year “would appear to be wrong” but refused to supply alternative figures.

The bank added: “Of those customers that are actually on SVRs, our research tells us that almost all either have nominal balances or have made an active choice to remain on that rate due to the additional flexibility to overpay it provides.

“We write to customers throughout the six months before their deal ends to explain the options available. Each year we help hundreds of thousands of our customers arrange new mortgage deals, and save money, as a previous one ends.”

NatWest said it has “a very low number” of customers on SVRs and that the bank does not require customers to opt for SVR unless they have less than £10,000 remaining on their mortgage.

Less than 2pc of HSBC’s mortgage book is on SVRs, and since December 2021 the bank has increased its SVR by 3.45 percentage points compared with a larger Bank Rate increase last year of 4.90 percentage points.

The bank said: “We are firmly focused on supporting our customers through current pressures and providing competitive rates, whether that is across savings or mortgages.”

Santander’s standard variable rate has remained 7.5pc since March. Its customers can switch to a fixed product with no fees and face no early repayment charges."
This bank is paying investors to wait for better times,"One of the biggest banking names on the UK high street, Lloyds has millions of customers trusting it with their money and as a source of borrowing.

In this context, it is no surprise the bank has been one of the most popular shares in Isas and pensions for decades.

However, the fact its share price is still below pre-Covid levels implies investors need to think differently about the role of Lloyds in their portfolio.

It is fair to suggest the sluggish share price performance is down to the mixed outlook for earnings.

In theory, the sharp rise in interest rates should have supercharged profits for the banking sector.

However, this year’s profit forecast for Lloyds is exactly the same as what it achieved in 2019 when interest rates were significantly lower than today. The analyst forecast is £7.5bn underlying pre-tax profit in 2023, falling to £7.3bn in 2024.

Yes, that is a lot of money but a cynic might suggest the black horse has been sleeping in the stable rather than running through the meadow. Investors want profit progression.

Four years ago, Lloyds’ shares were trading around 50p versus 45p today. Dividends were higher back then (3.37p per share in 2019), compared with 2.78p per share expected this year. If it were not for the big dividends then investors would have bolted long ago.

So, what now? Investors need to give up on the idea they will make capital gains with the stock in the current environment. The shares trade on one-time tangible net assets – in a bull market for equities that is likely to be the floor, but it could also be the ceiling for Lloyds’ valuation heading into a potential recession.

That the bank’s impairment charge for potential bad loans in the second quarter hit £419m versus £200m a year earlier suggests Lloyds is preparing itself for a tougher future.

The figure was a shock given analysts had forecast £371m in impairments for the quarter. Higher interest rates put more pressure on consumers and businesses and the consequences are still playing out.

The prospect of a recession or slow economic growth means that Lloyds’ investors will have no choice but to focus on dividends, forecast to grow to 3.12p in 2024 and 3.52p in 2025. The latter implies a 7.8% yield on the current share price. Put simply, Lloyds is paying investors to wait for better times.

Lloyds Banking Group is owner of The Telegraph. It has no involvement in editorial matters.

Update: Shanta Gold
Investing in gold miners is fraught with danger, particularly when a company starts a new mining operation. It is normal to have teething problems at launch and for the processing plant and other equipment to need fine-tuning.

Shanta Gold’s latest update could have been make or break for the share price. Having poured first gold from its Singida project in Tanzania on March 30, the subsequent few months were always going to have been a sensitive period for the new mine.

While Shanta issued a reassuring statement on 1 June that Singida had reached commercial production status and it implied everything was working, the market had to wait until July 20 for proper insight into its performance.

The second quarter update knocked the market for six, sending the share price up 10pc in a day.

Singida’s launch had gone better than anyone expected, with gold production 19pc ahead of company forecasts for the three-month period.

Shareholders needed that good news as there has been more drama with Shanta as an investment in recent years than an episode of Eastenders.

The share price sank in June on reports and then confirmation that major shareholder Odey Asset Management had dumped the bulk of its holding in the gold miner. Allegations of improper conduct by Crispin Odey led to the asset management firm he founded having to liquidate holdings to raise cash to meet client redemptions.

Two years ago, Shanta’s shares took a hit after it drastically reduced production guidance after lower-than-expected gold grades at its New Luika mine in Tanzania. Last year there was euphoria around takeover interest for the miner, which came to nothing. The gold price has also been up and down like a yo-yo over the past three years.

These events are reminders that investing in gold miners is not for the faint-hearted. However, for those eager to stay the course, Shanta’s latest news provides reassurance.

Having two operating mines means it now has multiple sources of revenue. The company also has growing confidence in its West Kenya exploration project which could potentially become its third money-maker, although significantly more analysis must be conducted by Shanta before a development decision can be made."
Lloyds chief says bank in no rush to sell The Telegraph,"The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group has said he is in no rush to sell The Telegraph after seizing control from the Barclay family in a dispute over debts secured against the business.

Charlie Nunn, the lender’s chief executive, made Lloyds’ first public comments on the situation since he sent in receivers and ousted Barclay family representatives from the board of The Telegraph last month.

With a General Election looming, senior Conservatives have expressed concerns about Lloyds owning an influential news organisation. Some called for new long-term ownership for the company to be secured as soon as possible as it navigates the shift to digital subscriptions.

However, Mr Nunn said: “There’s no need to have a rushed sale process here.”

The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine, which was also owned by the Barclay family in the same group of companies, are “are well-performing businesses”, he added. The Telegraph this week reported a pre-tax profit for 2022 of £39m, an increase of 32pc.

Mr Nunn, who took over the running of Lloyds from Antonio Horta-Osorio in 2021,  said he took ownership of The Telegraph because the debt secured against it “has been in remediation for a long time”.

“I inherited that situation and we felt it was the right time to take the action we’ve taken on behalf of our shareholders and make sure we were trying to get the right economic return on the debt that we had been providing to the companies and the family.”

It is understood the debt was more than £1bn. Lloyds has written off some or all of it in its accounts and so stands to profit from a sale of The Telegraph expected to begin formally in September.

Mr Nunn said: “We’ve set up an independent receivership and this is all being managed totally independently from executives at Lloyds Banking Group. You can imagine why that’s important for us and for me personally so we aren’t involved in the decision making around how the process is being run.

“We’ve given the receivers the complete freedom to run a process with the right diligence and, from our perspective, to ensure the process is run well from a UK perspective and maximise the returns for our shareholders.”

Receivers from the specialist consultancy AlixPartners have appointed the City veteran Mike McTighe to oversee the auction as chairman of The Telegraph’s parent company. Mr McTighe is also chairman of BT’s network arm Openreach and the spreadbetting provider IG Group, and is well-known to Lloyds from his work on previous debt restructuring processes.

Britain’s biggest mortgage lender warns more customers are struggling,"Lloyds Banking Group has warned an increasing number of homeowners are struggling to repay their debts as rising interest rates bite.

The lender said it set aside £662m for bad loan provisions during the first half of the year, compared to £381m during the same period last year.

Charlie Nunn, Lloyds group chief executive, said: “We know that rising interest rates, cost-of-living pressures and an uncertain economic outlook are proving challenging for many people and businesses.

“We remain fully focused on proactively supporting our customers and helping them navigate the current environment.”

Despite the impairment charge, Lloyds posted a 23pc surge in half-year profits to £3.9bn.

The profit boost was driven by a rise in the bank’s net interest margin – the difference between what lenders charge borrowers and pay savers – to 3.1pc, up from 2.77pc a year earlier.

Banks have come under fire from ministers and regulators over accusations they are profiteering from rising rates at a time when borrowers are struggling.

Lenders have been accused of being too slow to pass on the benefits of rising interest rates to customers through higher savings rates.

Lloyds, which also owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland, said business had slowed in recent months.

Profits between April and June came in at £1.6bn, down by nearly a third compared to the first quarter but in line with the same period last year.

Shares fell around 2.5pc in afternoon trading, valuing Lloyds at just under £29bn.

Meanwhile, Santander UK warned of a looming slump in the housing market. Santander predicted an 11pc drop in house prices over this year and next.

The lender said that if inflation proves exceptionally stubborn and forces the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 7pc, from their current level of 5pc, it would force the economy into recession and send house prices tumbling by almost 20pc.

It warned that £60bn of mortgage loans will roll off fixed-term deals or introductory offers in the next 18 months.

The bank said typical affordability tests on mortgages issued before December 2021 checked homebuyers’ ability to repay their loans at an interest rate of 6.35pc, a level which looked high at the time but is now close to the average rates available.

Mike Regnier, the bank’s chief executive, said: “We know that the ongoing volatility in the mortgage market and continuing inflationary pressures are creating challenges, and we encourage anyone facing difficulties to get in touch as soon as possible.”

Santander received fewer home loan applications in the first six months of the year and cut back its own mortgage lending by £8.4bn.

Despite storm clouds on the horizon, Santander reported an 18pc jump in pre-tax profits to £1.17bn in the first half of the year as higher interest rates helped push up earnings up by £180m."
